Conf Hop Conf is a command line tool to manage various aspects of your Hop configuration: projects, environments, cloud configuration and more Hop Encrypt Hop Encrypt is a command line tool that obfuscates or encrypts a plain text password for use in XML, password or metadata files. Make sure to also copy the password encryption prefix to indicate the obfuscated nature of the password. Hop will then be able to make the distinction between regular plain text passwords and obfuscated ones. Hop Gui Hop Gui is the visual IDE where Hop data developers create, test, run and manage the life cycle for workflows and pipelines. In addition to functionality for development and life cycle management, Hop Gui contains tools and perspectives to manage projects and environments, to search and manage metadata, to manage and version control a large variety of files and to explore logging in a Neo4j graph. Hop Run Hop Run is a command line tool to run workflows and pipelines, with options to (list or) specify projects, environments, properties and run configurations. Hop Search Hop Search is a command line tool to search all metadata available in a specific project or environment. Hop Server Hop Server is a web service interface to manage and run workflows and pipelines. Action An Action is one operation performed in a Workflow. Actions are executed sequentially by default, with parallel execution as a configuration option. An Action returns a true or false exit code, which can be used (or ignored) in the Workflow’s execution. Hop A Hop links Actions in a Workflow or Transforms in a Pipeline. In Workflows, Hops operate based on the exit status of previous Actions, Hops in Pipelines pass data between Transforms. Pipeline Pipelines are the actual data workers. Operations in a Pipeline read, modify, enrich, clean and write data. Orchestration of Pipelines is done through othere Pipelines and/or Workflows. Transform A Transform is a unit of work performed in a Pipeline. Typical Transform operations are reading data from files, databases, performing lookups or joins, enriching, cleaning data and more. All transforms in a Pipeline are executed in parallel. Transforms process data and move batches of processed data on Hops for processing by subsequent Actions. Workflow A Workflow is a sequence of operations that are performed sequentially by default (with optional parallel execution). Workflows usually do not operate on the data directly, but perform orchestration tasks. Typical tasks in a Workflow consist of retrieving and archiving data, sending emails, error handling etc. ) Project Hop Projects are a conceptual grouping of configurations, variables, metadata objects and workflows and pipelines. Projects can inherit metadata from parent projects. A project contains one or more environments where the actual configuration is defined. Example: a 'Sales' project contains a 'customers' database connection and a number of workflows and pipelines. The runtime configurations, database connection properties etc are defined in the 'dev', 'uat' and 'prd' environments. Environment Hop Environments are instances of projects that hold the actual runtime configurations and other metadata objects for a project. Example: the 'dev' environment for the 'Sales' project specifies to read from host '10.0.0.1' for the 'customers' database connection Hop Metadata is the central storage repository for shared metadata like relational database connections, run configurations, servers, git repositories and so on. Metadata is persisted as json and is stored by default in a project’s base folder. The following items are an alphabetically ordered list of concepts that are used throughout Hop and will be mentioned at various locations in the Hop tools and documentation. Lazy Loading If enabled, all data conversions (character decoding, data conversion, trimming, …​) for the data being read will be postponed as long as possible, effectively reading the data as binary fields. Enabling lazy conversion can significantly decrease the CPU cost of reading data. When to avoid: if the data conversion needs to be performed later in the stream anyway, postponing the conversion may slow things down instead of speeding up. When to use: use cases where Lazy Conversion may speed things up when 1) data is read and written to another file without conversion, 2) data needs to be sorted and doesn’t fit in memory. In this case, serialization to disk is faster with lazy conversion because encoding and type conversions are postponed, or 3) bulk-loading to database without the need for data conversion. Bulk loading utilities typically read text directly and the generation of this text is faster (this does not apply to Table Output).","title":"Concepts","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"concepts","url":"/manual/latest/concepts.html","titles":[{"text":"Tools","hash":"_tools","id":1},{"text":"Item types","hash":"_item_types","id":2},{"text":"Projects and Environments","hash":"_projects_and_environments","id":3},{"text":"Metadata","hash":"_metadata","id":4},{"text":"Various","hash":"_various","id":5}]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"Hop is not the only data integration and data orchestration platform out there. Many of the tasks that can be performed with Hop can also be achieved with other data platforms. In the next paragraphs, we’ll take a closer look at what makes Hop unique, and why the Hop team truly believes Hop is exploring the future of data integration and orchestration. Metadata is the single most important concept in Apache Hop. Metadata is what drives everything: from workflows and pipelines over connections to a large variety of platforms to run configurations, every item you work with in Hop is defined as metadata. Hop’s metadata-driven approach is taken to the next level with metadata injection (MDI). Metadata injection pipelines use a template pipeline and inject the necessary metadata in runtime. This significantly reduces the amount of repetitive manual development, resulting in smaller and more manageable pipeline code. Hop GUI is a full-blown visual IDE that is available on the desktop (Windows, Mac OS and Linux) and in your browser (Hop Web). With Hop GUI, data developers can visually design, run and debug workflows and pipelines. This visual way of working gives developers the power to be more productive than they could ever be with “real” hand-crafted code. Not only are Hop workflows and pipelines easy to create with the visual editor, maintaining visual code is a lot easier as well. Identifying and fixing a problem in a well-defined visual layout is a lot easier than it would be if you had to scroll through lines and lines of source code. Hop’s architecture has been designed from the ground up to keep the core functionality in a clean, fast, robust and lightweight kernel. All other functionality is added through plugins that can be added or removed at will. This allows Hop to work from edge devices in IoT scenarios to processing the largest amounts of data in realtime, streaming, batch or hybrid scenarios. This plugin architecture is open to external developers, enabling them to add their own plugins and taking the already extensive Hop functionality even further. Hop’s portable runtime configurations allow data developers to design a workflow or pipeline once and run it on the environment and configuration where it fits best. Hop supports its own native runtime engine that can be used both locally and on a remote server. Additionally, your pipelines can run on Apache Spark or Flink clusters, or on Google Cloud’s Dataflow over Apache Beam, with support for additional runtimes to be added in later versions. This ability gives you the unparalleled flexibility to let your Hop projects grow with your data volumes and data architecture. Through proper logging and monitoring, you’ll know if your Hop workflows and pipelines run without any errors. However, that doesn’t tell you anything about whether your data has been processed correctly. Hop’s unit testing offers data developers a way to validate the data processing against a golden data set, so you’ll not only know your workflows and pipelines run without any errors, but also that the data was processed as expected. Regression tests guarantee that a bug that was once fixed remains fixed. A library of integration tests that are run periodically allow Hop projects to continuously guarantee your workflows and pipelines process your data exactly the way they were designed to. All major data endeavours cover more than a single topic. Typical data teams cover multiple topics and run those in a number of environments. Hop projects and environments allow data teams to organize their work in separate Hop projects, typically with different environment configurations per project. Hop projects and environments, both in separate version control repositories, allow your projects to be taken over development, through testing, into production while keeping complete control and overview. Hop offers all the tools required to keep full control over your data project’s life cycle. Hop integrates and evolves with your data architecture and your projects and environments both managed in version control, managed runtime configurations and a library of unit, regression and integration tests, your Hop implementation is in perfect shape. The workflows and pipelines in your Hop projects can be run continuously from CI/CD pipelines, validating and testing every step in the process and processing your data exactly the way you intend it to. Even though other platforms allow to be implemented this way, Hop is unique in that it was designed exactly to build robust, end-to-end data processing and orchestration solutions.","title":"Hop Unique Selling Propositions","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"hop-usps","url":"/manual/latest/hop-usps.html","titles":[{"text":"Metadata Driven","hash":"_metadata_driven","id":1},{"text":"Visual Code Editor","hash":"_visual_code_editor","id":2},{"text":"Kernel Architecture and plugins","hash":"_kernel_architecture_and_plugins","id":3},{"text":"Portable Runtime Configurations","hash":"_portable_runtime_configurations","id":4},{"text":"Unit and Integration Testing","hash":"_unit_and_integration_testing","id":5},{"text":"Projects and environments","hash":"_projects_and_environments","id":6},{"text":"Life Cycle Management","hash":"_life_cycle_management","id":7}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"This page is used to test if images work in both the documentation and the book more text","title":"Image testpage","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"image-testpage","url":"/manual/latest/image-testpage.html","titles":[]},"4":{"id":4,"text":"The Apache Hop User Manual contains all the information you need to develop and deploy data solutions with Apache Hop.

This page covers everything you need to know to install and run Apache Hop on your local desktop or server, from the very basics to more advanced configurations. Hop is designed to be as flexible and lightweight as possible, and is intended to blend in with your architecture, not the other way around. This makes the basic installation process extremely easy, but there’s a lot of configuration that can be applied to make Hop behave exactly the way you want it to. Take a look at the Docker page for instructions to run Hop in containers and Kubernetes environments. Hop’s limited footprint should allow it to run on any modern physical or virtual machine. For the default Hop distribution, a minimum of 1 CPU/core and 4GB RAM should do, even though you can tweak Hop to run on machines with even less memory. Hop Runs on the following operating systems: Windows 7 or higher Linux (x86_64, ARM) MacOS any modern browser (Hop Web) The only requirement Hop has on any supported operating system is the Java Runtime environment. Apache Hop is known to work well on the following widely used Java Runtimes: Oracle Java Runtime Microsoft OpenJDK (OpenJDK builds for Windows, MacOS and Linux). OpenJDK Java Runtime Apache Hop works well with these 64-bit java runtimes for version 11. Other Java Runtimes may work but haven’t been used and tested as extensively as the Oracle and OpenJDK JREs, so you may be pioneering. Feel free to open a GitHub ticket if you run into issues, but please mention your JRE and version. Run java -version if you’re not sure which Java version is currently installed on your system. Your output should be similar to the one shown below. openjdk version \"11.0.2\" 2019-01-15 OpenJDK Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.2+9) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.2+9, mixed mode) Make sure to point the JAVA_HOME environment variable for your operating system to your desired JRE installation. Refer to your operating system’s documentation for more information on environment variables. The basic installation for Apache Hop couldn’t be easier: download unzip change to your newly unzipped hop directory run: hop-gui.bat (Windows) or hop-gui.sh (Linux, MacOS): run Hop Gui hop-run.bat (Windows) or hop-run.sh (Linux, MacOS): run workflows or pipelines from the command line. hop-server.bat (Windows) or hop-server.sh (Linux, MacOS): start a Hop Server instance. Apache Hop’s installation and configuration are fully self-contained by default. With the system or environment variables below, you can make your Hop configuration independent of the installed Hop versions. This lets you switch between Hop versions or installations, while keeping your projects and environment lists, last opened files and other settings. if you set the environment variables below after you’ve been using Apache Hop for a while, you can move the contents of your hop/config/ folder to your new HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER location There are several ways to access the Environment Variables in Windows. One ways is to search for environment variable in the start menu and clicking the \"Edit the system environment variables\" link (or the corresponding entry for your local language). In the dialog that pops up, click the Environment Variables button, then add a new HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER user variable and point it to the folder where you’d like to store your Apache Hop configuration. Repeat the process for any of the other variables list below you want to add to your configuration. Click Ok to close the dialogs and (re)start Hop Gui to activate the environment variables. Add environment variables to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc or similar configuration file as shown below: export HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER=. run source ~/.bashrc or source ~/.zshrc to apply the new variables in your current session. HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER Hop stores your configuration in the config folder by default. Set this environment variable to point to a folder outside of your Hop installation to keep your configuration, projects and environment list etc, no matter which Hop version or installation you use. copy the contents of an existing hop/conf folder to the path set in HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER to move the configuration from one of your Hop installations to your new central location. HOP_AUDIT_FOLDER Set this variable to a valid path on your machine to store Hop’s audit information. This information includes last opened files per project, zoom size and lots more. HOP_OPTIONS Set this variable to add JVM options, e.g. -Xmx=2g. This variables' value overrules the settings in the various scripts in your Apache Hop installation. Check the Environment Variables section for more system variables that can make your life with multiple Hop versions or installations a lot easier. Multiple Hop versions can be installed side by side with the same process as described in the Basic Installation. Hop installations are self-contained by default, which means you’ll start with the default configuration and project and environment list with after new Hop install. With the environment variables described in the previous section, all you need to do to upgrade Apache Hop next to your existing hop installation and start Hop Gui from there. Your projects and environment lists, last opened files etc should all be available. Apache Hop releases are tested for smooth upgrades. You can replace your existing installation when a new version is released. If you want to keep multiple Apache Hop versions around, consider renaming your unzipped hop folder to hop-version-number, e.g. hop-2.5.0, hop-2.60 etc. By default, Hop only sets a maximum for the JVM Heap size Hop can allocate. This parameter can be changed in the hop-gui.bat or hop-gui.sh or similar scripts for hop-run and hop-server. Identify the following line: HOP_OPTIONS=\"-Xmx2048m\" The -Xmx parameter determines the maximum amount of memory the JVM can allocate and can be specified in MB or GB. For example: HOP_OPTIONS=-Xmx512m: start Hop with maximum 512MB of memory HOP_OPTIONS=-Xmx2048m: start Hop with maximum 2048MB (or 2GB) of memory HOP_OPTIONS=-Xmx4g: start Hop with maximum 4GB of memory Check the documentation for your JRE for more information about additional JVM configuration, tuning and garbage collection parameters. This guide may help you to get started. Developers: a couple of lines below the -Xmx parameter, you’ll find another HOP_OPTIONS line that contains -Xdebug. Uncomment this line to allow debuggers to attach to your running Hop instance. Check the developer documentation for more information. The following (operating system) environment variables can add a lot of flexibility to configure Hop to your exact needs. HOP_AUDIT_FOLDER Set this variable to a valid path on your machine to store Hop’s audit information. This information includes last opened files per project, zoom size and lots more. HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER Hop stores your configuration in the config folder by default. Set this environment variable to point to a folder outside of your Hop installation to keep your configuration, projects and environment list etc, no matter which Hop version or installation you use. copy the contents of an existing hop/conf folder to the path set in HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER to move the configuration from one of your Hop installations to your new central location. HOP_PLUGIN_BASE_FOLDERS Set this variable to point Hop to a comma separated list of folders where you want Hop to look for additional plugins. When using this variable it will also unset your default plugins folder, make sure to add the default plugin folder to the comma separated list. This can be a relative path to the installation eg. export HOP_PLUGIN_BASE_FOLDERS=./plugins,/additional/plugin/folder. The ./plugins will point to the plugins in the base installation folder HOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDERS This is a comma separated list of folder containing JDBC drivers, default value is lib/jdbc. If you still need the default jdbc drivers when changing this you need to include the default folder path. Hop comes with built-in support for tens of databases and a large number of other technologies. Depending on the Apache and technology vendor’s licenses, the required libraries may not be available in the default Apache Hop distribution. Download the necessary drivers or other required libraries and add them to your plugin’s lib directory. For example, to add a JDBC driver for the MySQL database, download the MySQL JDBC jar file and add it to /hop/plugins/databases/mysql. Add any custom jars in lib/core in your Hop installation folder to make those libraries available for your entire Hop installation. Add any custom jars to plugins/transforms/janino/lib to make them available for the User Defined Java Class transform. Hop comes with built-in support for lots of technologies that may require their own (installation and) configuration. Check the technology page for the platform you need to configure to find out more.","title":"Apache Hop requirements, installation and configuration","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"installation-configuration","url":"/manual/latest/installation-configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"System Requirements","hash":"_system_requirements","id":2},{"text":"Java Runtime","hash":"_java_runtime","id":3},{"text":"Basic Installation","hash":"basic","id":4},{"text":"Set (system) environment variables","hash":"_set_system_environment_variables","id":5},{"text":"Create environment variables in Windows","hash":"_create_environment_variables_in_windows","id":6},{"text":"Create environment variables in Mac OS or Linux","hash":"_create_environment_variables_in_mac_os_or_linux","id":7},{"text":"The environment variables to set","hash":"_the_environment_variables_to_set","id":8},{"text":"Upgrade","hash":"_upgrade","id":9},{"text":"Additional configuration","hash":"_additional_configuration","id":10},{"text":"JVM memory settings","hash":"_jvm_memory_settings","id":11},{"text":"Hop environment variables","hash":"envvars","id":12},{"text":"JDBC Drivers, Jars, Libraries, and other plugin dependencies","hash":"_jdbc_drivers_jars_libraries_and_other_plugin_dependencies","id":13},{"text":"Technology configuration","hash":"_technology_configuration","id":14}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"To run apache hop you need java JVM, with the amount of JVMs in the market and with more to come apache Hop can have issues running in certain JVMs. This page covers what JVM we are giving support and the ones we have black listed.

It’s simply bad form to hardcode host names, user names, passwords, directories and so on. Variables allow your solutions to adapt to a changing environment. If for example the database server is different when developing than it is when running in production, you set it as a variable. Fields, parameters, and variables implicitly are available downstream if in scope. You can pass them again any number of levels, but the \"get parameters/variables\" button only retrieves from one level above. Fields are columns in data row(s) and are viewable in some transform field textboxes and columns and you can see the fields in scope and its value when looking at transform row results after executing a workflow/pipeline (click the little grid icon on the bottom-right of a transform to see a preview of the cached results). Field values can be passed upstream for example if you use a pipeline executor and fill in the Result rows tab and use it in conjunction with a “copy rows to result” transform in the child pipeline. Think of parameters as function arguments, which turn into variables with the same name. When adding parameters you are basically creating MyPipeline(parameter1, parameter2,..). Parameters (e.g. in pipeline or workflow properties) need to be declared at least once in every pipeline or workflow. For example, if you set parameters on a pipeline executor, the pipeline that is being called must declare the same parameter names in its pipeline properties (set to NULL if you want to inherit values). Parameters can not be “sent” upstream, but you can use a Set variables transform, but they become variables in the scope they are defined in. Explicit vs Implicit: If you set a parameter to a default value, it becomes explicit (e.g. when editing a pipeline in pipeline properties), and it will take precedence over the same named implicit variable (a passed-in variable), but not take precedence over the same named explicit parameter. So whenever you see a transform with a column title “Parameters/Variables” that means an explicit parameter is sent to a function that will then set a variable name overriding any previous set parameter with the same name (useful if wanting to override an explicitly set param/variable in the child). To change implicit parameter behaviour to explicit, you can also disable “pass all parameters” on the pipeline action. Parameters are simply variables which are explicitly defined in a workflow or pipeline to make them recognizable from outside those objects. They can also have a description and a default value. You cannot combine implicit variable inheritance with explicit parameter definitions. So, if you add parameters to the pipeline definition (or to a pipeline executor) and you want it set, you must add it to the parameters tab of the child pipeline action/transform even if the same variable already exists. Advanced: there are multiple layers in hop where you can set variables that do or do not get overwritten downstream (Java → hop environment → project → run configuration → workflow → pipeline). Variables are more global and the scope can be targeted (entire Java VM, grandparent workflow, etc.) whereas fields are the data flowing between the transforms. Local variables can be set in a pipeline but should not be used in the same pipeline as they are not thread-safe and can inherit a previous value. It is better to send or return variables to another pipeline/workflow before using them. Variables can be passed upstream if the variable was set to a larger scope. E.g.: if a variable was set in a parent with \"valid in the current workflow\". Think of variables in 2 scopes: runtime variables and environment/workflow variables: Runtime variables – Runtime variables depend on pipeline information to generate, so they cannot be set beforehand, you need to declare those differently to be able to use them. Environment/workflow variables or parameters – Environment variables/parameters are set once and used when needed in any downstream workflow/pipeline and there is no need to use Get Variables , you can refer to them directly like ${myVariable} unless you need it in a field/data stream. E.g.: Define a parameter only once, even just in the Pipeline Executor (no need to define in receiving pipeline) A pipeline needs to start to get new variables. A running or nested pipeline can’t fetch new variable values. A pipeline is considered started when a pipeline starts for every row in a pipeline executor. An alternative is to use parameters. In the Hop user interface all places where you can enter a variable have a '$' symbol to the right of the input field: You can specify a variable by referencing it between an opening ${ and a closing }. ${VARIABLE_NAME} Please note that in the case of a textvar (a text field that supports variables), you don’t have to specify a variable in these places. You can enter hard-coded values (although we advise to use variables where possible). Combinations of a variable with other free-form text are also possible, like in the example below: ${ENVIRONMENT_HOME}/input/source-file.txt You can see a list of defined variables by using CTRL-SPACE (CMD-SPACE on OSX) in the input field. This helper will insert a selected variable into the input field. Only environment variables and variables with the JVM scope are shown here. Variables that are created in pipeline or workflow with a parent, grant parent or root workflow job need to be entered manually In rare cases you might have a need to enter non-character values as separators in 'binary' text files with for example a zero byte as a separator. In those scenarios you can use a special 'variable' format: $[] A few examples: Value Meaning $[0D] A Newline character (CR) $[0A] A Newline character (LF) $[00] A single byte with decimal value 0 $[FFFF] Two bytes with decimal value 65535 $[CEA3] The 2 bytes representing UTF-8 character Σ $[e28ca8] The 3 bytes representing UTF-8 character ⌨ $[f09d849e] The 4 bytes representing UTF-8 character 𝄞 Variables can be defined and set in all the places where it makes sense: in hop-config.json when it applies to the installation in an environment configuration file when it concerns a specific lifecycle environment In a project In a pipeline run configuration As a default parameter value in a pipeline or workflow Using the Set Variables transform in a pipeline Using the Set Variables action in a workflow When executing with Hop run Variables are local to the place where they are defined. This means that setting them in a certain place means that it’s going to be inherited from that place on. This also means that’s important to know where variables can be set and used and the hierarchy behind it. Table 1. Variables Hierarchy Place Inheritance System properties Inherited by the JVM and all other places in Hop Environment Inherited by run configurations Run Configurations Pipeline run configurations are inherited by the environment Pipeline Inherited by the pipeline run configuration Workflow Inherited by the workflow run configuration Metadata objects Inherited by the place where it is loaded Pipeline and workflows can (optionally) accept parameters. Workflow and pipeline parameters are similar, and are a special type of variable that is only available within the current workflow or pipeline. Workflow and pipeline parameters can have a default value and a description, and can be passed on from workflows and pipelines to other workflows and pipelines through a variety of workflow actions and pipeline transforms. All system properties are variables that are available in all of your currently running Apache Hop instance. System properties are available as variables as well as all Java system properties. System properties get set in the Java Virtual Machine that runs your Apache Hop instance. This means that you should limit yourself to only those variables which are really system specific. You can add your own system variables to the ones that come with Apache Hop by default in the System Variables tab in the configuration perspective. These variables will be written to the hop-config.json file in your hop installation’s config folder or in your ${HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER} location. even though you can manually change the hop-config.json or any of the other configuration files, you’ll rarely, if ever, need to. Only change hop-config.json manually if you know what you’re doing. { \"systemProperties\" : { \"MY_SYSTEM_PROPERTY\" : \"SomeValue\" } } You can also use the hop-config command line tool to define system properties: sh hop-config.sh -s MY_SYSTEM_PROPERTY=SomeValue You can specify variables in project lifecycle environments as well. This helps you configure folders and other things which are environment specific, and lets you keep a clean separation between code (your project) and configuration (your environment). You can set those in the environment settings dialog or using the command line: sh hop-config.sh -e MyEnvironment -em -ev VARIABLE1=value1 You can specify variables in pipeline run configurations and workflow run configurations to make a pipeline or workflow run in an engine agnostic way. For example, you can have the same pipeline run on Hadoop with Spark and specify an input directory using hdfs:// and on Google DataFlow using gs:// You can define variables in a workflow either with the Set Variables, JavaScript actions or by using parameters. You can define variables in a pipeline either with the Set Variables, JavaScript transforms or by defining parameters. IMPORTANT As mentioned in the Set Variables documentation page, you can’t set and use variables in the same pipeline, since all transforms in a pipeline run in parallel. The following variables are available in Hop through the configuration perspective. If you have the menu toolbar enabled in the configuration perspective’s General tab, these variables are also available through Tools → Edit config variables. Variable name Default Value Description HOP_AGGREGATION_ALL_NULLS_ARE_ZERO N Set this variable to Y to return 0 when all values within an aggregate are NULL. Otherwise by default a NULL is returned when all values are NULL. HOP_AGGREGATION_MIN_NULL_IS_VALUED N Set this variable to Y to set the minimum to NULL if NULL is within an aggregate.

If this setting is set to \"Y\", an string starting with digits will be converted successfully into a number. (example: 192.168.1.1 will be converted into 192 or 192.168 or 192168 depending on the decimal and grouping symbol). The default (N) will be to throw an error if non-numeric symbols are found in the string. HOP_LICENSE_HEADER_FILE - This is the name of the variable which when set should contains the path to a file which will be included in the serialization of pipelines and workflows HOP_LOG_MARK_MAPPINGS N Set this variable to 'Y' to precede transform/action name in log lines with the complete path to the transform/action. Useful to perfectly identify where a problem happened in our process.

HOP_SERVER_REFRESH_STATUS - A variable to configure refresh for Hop server workflow/pipeline status page HOP_SPLIT_FIELDS_REMOVE_ENCLOSURE N Set this variable to N to preserve enclosure symbol after splitting the string in the Split fields transform. Changing it to true will remove first and last enclosure symbol from the resulting string chunks. HOP_SYSTEM_HOSTNAME You can use this variable to speed up hostname lookup. Hostname lookup is performed by Hop so that it is capable of logging the server on which a workflow or pipeline is executed. HOP_TRANSFORM_PERFORMANCE_SNAPSHOT_LIMIT 0 The maximum number of transform performance snapshots to keep in memory. Set to 0 to keep all snapshots indefinitely (default) HOP_USE_NATIVE_FILE_DIALOG N Set this value to Y if you want to use the system file open/save dialog when browsing files HOP_ZIP_MAX_ENTRY_SIZE_DEFAULT_STRING HOP_ZIP_MAX_TEXT_SIZE - A variable to configure the maximum number of characters of text that are extracted before an exception is thrown during extracting text from documents HOP_ZIP_MAX_TEXT_SIZE_DEFAULT_STRING - HOP_ZIP_MIN_INFLATE_RATIO - A variable to configure the minimum allowed ratio between de- and inflated bytes to detect a zipbomb HOP_ZIP_MIN_INFLATE_RATIO_DEFAULT_STRING - NEO4J_LOGGING_CONNECTION Set this variable to the name of an existing Neo4j connection to enable execution logging to a Neo4j database. Set the environment variables listed below in your operating system to configure Hop’s startup behavior: HOP_AUDIT_FOLDER Set this variable to a valid path on your machine to store Hop’s audit information. This information includes last opened files per project, zoom size and lots more. HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER Hop stores your configuration in the config folder by default. Set this environment variable to point to a folder outside of your Hop installation to keep your configuration, projects and environment list etc, no matter which Hop version or installation you use. copy the contents of an existing hop/conf folder to the path set in HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER to move the configuration from one of your Hop installations to your new central location. HOP_PLUGIN_BASE_FOLDERS Set this variable to point Hop to a comma separated list of folders where you want Hop to look for additional plugins. When using this variable it will also unset your default plugins folder, make sure to add the default plugin folder to the comma separated list. This can be a relative path to the installation eg. export HOP_PLUGIN_BASE_FOLDERS=./plugins,/additional/plugin/folder. The ./plugins will point to the plugins in the base installation folder HOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDERS This is a comma separated list of folder containing JDBC drivers, default value is lib/jdbc. If you still need the default jdbc drivers when changing this you need to include the default folder path. Additionally, the following environment variables can help you to add even more fine-grained configuration for your Apache Hop installation: Variable Default Description HOP_AUTO_CREATE_CONFIG N Set this variable to 'Y' to automatically create config file when it’s missing.

Through VFS, Hop users can access various files from different sources such as files on the local disk, on a HTTP(S) server, inside a ZIP archive and so through a url format. Apache Hop makes fervent usage of VFS. Beyond the standard VFS file system types, we have added a number which are present in the various technology stacks supported by Hop. Like the standard file systems each has its own unique name scheme which you can use. The table below provides a quick overview of the VFS file systems supported by Apache Hop. Click the File system name to access more detailed file system documentation.

This freedom means you can be creative and productive in arriving at the desired outcome. So please consider the advice given on this page as tips or free advice to be taken or rejected for a particular situation. Only you can decide what the advice is worth. As your project grows, the importance of keeping things organized grows. A clearly organized project makes it easier to find the workflows, pipelines and other project artefacts, and makes your project easier to maintain overall. Your naming convention should not only cover all aspects of your projects. For Apache Hop, that means conventions for your workflows, pipelines, transforms, actions and metadata items. There’s more to your project than just Apache Hop, and other areas of your project are no exception. Input and output files, database tables etc will be a lot easier to manage if named clearly, cleanly and consistently. For larger projects, a formal naming conventions document helps to centrally manage the naming conventions, and helps to avoid confusion when different team members use their own naming conventions interchangeably. A naming convention should be maintained, updated, enforced and verified periodically. Automated naming convention checks (e.g. through scripts in commit hooks) could be considered to automate the validation of your naming conventions. Clearly named transforms and actions make your pipelines and workflows a lot easier to understand. The default action and transform names use the action or transform name. This makes it easy to understand what the transform does, but tell you nothing about the purpose it has in your workflow or pipeline. Filter rows (or god forbid, Filter rows 2 2 or similar names you get after copy/pasting transforms) doesn’t tell you anything. A short but concise transform name like start_date < today tells you exactly what is going on in a filter transform. For example, for input and output files, you could use the filename you’re reading from or writing to. You can use (copy/paste) any unicode character in the name of a transform or action and even newlines are allowed. Metadata item names like relational database connections should immediately tell you what data they contain or what their purpose is. Metadata item names shouldn’t contain technical or environment details. For example, if your CRM system runs in a Postgresql database, CRM is fine as a name. Your connection is configured for an Oracle database, so that doesn’t need to be repeated in the name. Environment information should be configured in your project lifecycle environments, so there’s no need to include dev, test or prod in your connection names. Organizing your project in clearly named folders and subfolders makes everything easier to find, to organize and to maintain. Avoid keeping tens or hundreds of workflow files in a single folder. Keep the number of actions in your workflows and transforms in your pipelines within reason. Larger pipelines or workflows become harder to debug and develop against. For every transform you add to a pipeline you start at least one new thread at runtime. You could be slowing down significantly simply by having hundreds of threads for hundreds of transforms. If you find that you need to split up a pipeline you can write intermediate data to a temporary file using the Serialize to file transform. The next pipeline in a workflow can then pick up the data again with the De-serialize from file transform. While obviously you can also use a database or use another file type to do the same, these transforms will perform the fastest. Parameterize everything! Variables provide an easy way to avoid hard-coding all sorts of things in your system, environment or project. Put environment specific settings in one or more environment configuration files. This allows you to deploy your project to another environment (dev/uat/prod) without changing your project, you’ll only need to configure another set of configuration files. When referencing file locations, prefer ${PROJECT_HOME} over expressions like ${Internal.Entry.Current.Directory} or ${Internal.Pipeline.Filename.Directory} Configure transform copies with variables to allow for easy transition between differently sized environments. use the Environment Variables to keep your projects and environments, audit information etc outside of your Apache Hop installation. Take some time to capture the logging of your workflows and pipelines, so you can easily find a trace of anything you have run. Things tend to go wrong when you least expect it and at that point you like being able to see what happened. See Logging Basics, Logging Reflection or consider logging to a Neo4j graph database. This last one allows you to browse the logging results in the Neo4j perspective. Other options include the Pipeline Log, Pipeline Probe, Workflow log and Execution Information Location. Take a look at the available options and choose a logging strategy that works for your project and team. Organize your project so that you can reuse pipelines or workflows that require the same operations in multiple locations. For example, this could be organized as utility folders, by using parameters or variables to add flexibility to your pippeline or workflow behavior. If you have recurring logic in various pipelines, consider using the Simple Mapping to avoid repeating the same logic over and over in your pipelines. The Simple Mapping is a pipeline reading from a Mapping Input and writing to a Mapping Output transform. You can re-use the work in other pipelines using the Simple Mapping transform. If you you need to create 'almost' the same pipeline a lot of times, consider using Metadata Injection to create re-usable template pipelines. Avoid manual population of dialogs Whenever you need dynamic ETL Supports data streaming As example use cases is Loading data from 50 different file formats into a database with one pipeline template. This helps you to automatically normalize and load property sets. Here are a few things to consider when looking at performance in a pipeline: Pipelines are networks: the speed of the network is limited by the slowest transform in it. Slow transforms are indicated when running in Hop GUI. You’ll see a dotted line around the slow transforms. Adding more copies and increasing parallelism is not always beneficial, but it can be. Definitely don’t overdo it. Running all of the transforms in your pipeline with multiple copies definitely will not help. Test, measure and iterate to improve performance. Optimizing performance requires measuring: take note of execution times and see if you should increase or decrease parallelism to help performance. The easiest way to loop over a set of values, rows, files, …​ is to use an Executor transform. Pipeline Executor : run a pipeline for each input row Workflow Executor : run a workflow for each input row Repeat: run a workflow or pipeline from a workflow action until a variable (value) is set. End Repeat: break out of a loop that was started by a Repeat action. Each of these options allows you to map field values to parameters for the child pipeline or workflow, making loops a breeze. Avoid the \"old\" way of looping in workflows through the Copy rows to result transform. This mostly still exists for historical reasons. It makes it hard to see what is going on inside your loop, and this way of looping won’t be around in Apache Hop forever. The Looping how-to guide provides more detailed information on the topic. The items below will make your Apache Hop project easier to manage, to monitor and to maintain. Version control your project folder. Reference cases (e.g. JIRA or GitHub issue tickets) in commits Make sure to have a backup and restore strategy, and test it. Run continuous integration Set up lifecycle environments (development, test, acceptance, production) Test your pipelines with unit tests.

If you are using an unsupported database, you can always create a generic connection. To create a database connection go to the metadata perspective, right-click on Relational Database Connections and select New. The connection is saved in a central location and can then be used by all pipelines and workflows. If you have set your project to work with Hop, the database information will be in the ${PROJECT_HOME}/metadata/rdbms folder. For each connection, separate a .json file will be generated in this folder. This json file will have the name of the connection and will contain all of the connection information. Apache Hop includes JDBC drivers for all databases that provide their drivers under a license that is compatible with the Apache Public License. All JDBC drivers that come with Apache Hop can be found in lib/jdbc in your Apache Hop installation folder. The documentation for the various database types in following subsections will show you whether the driver for your database is included. If it included, the connection editor will also show the version of the installed driver. If the driver isn’t included, the documentation will guide you to the download location. Set the HOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDERS environment variable to a folder that contains your additional JDBC folders. Having them in a central folder helps you to easily upgrade or change your Apache Hop installation, without the need to add your JDBC drivers every time. This variable accepts a comma separated list to point to multiple directories the default value when not set is lib/jdbc, e.g. /lib/jdbc,. To avoid conflicts, make sure you only have on driver for each database, and make sure you don’t have multiple copies of your drivers, e.g. both in HOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDERS and hop/lib/jdbc folder. When a specific database type is not yet available for the database you want to use, you can use the generic connection. To use a generic connection you have to copy your jdbc driver to the /lib/jdbc folder or in your HOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDERS folder. Check the documentation for your databases' driver class and URL syntax to create your connection. In the Driver Class field you specify your driver class, for example if you use PostgreSQL the class is org.postgresql.Driver. The advanced tab lets you specify a number of additional properties for your database connection. Property Description Supports the Boolean data type is Boolean supported? Supports the Timestamp data type is Timestamp supported? Quote all identifiers in database Add quotes around all identifiers for generated SQL statements.

The SQL statements to run after connection (; separated a semicolon (';') separated list of SQL statements that need to be executed after the connection is created. The options table contains a list of key/value pairs that can be added to your JDBC driver. Check your database JDBC driver documentation for the right syntax. For example, to add additional options to a MS SQL database, you can add options to achieve a JDBC URL like the one below.

Metadata is by far the most important concept in all of Hop. Every item we’ll cover below is defined as metadata. All interactions between Hop and other components in your data architecture are done through metadata. Metadata is at the core of everything in Hop. Pipelines are collections of transforms, connected by hops. All transforms in a pipeline run in parallel. Workflows are collections of actions, connected by hops. All actions in a workflow run sequentially by default. Projects are logical collections of hop code and configuration. Environments contain the environment-specific (e.g. dev, uat, prd) metadata. Action An Action is one operation performed in a Workflow. Actions are executed sequentially by default, with parallel execution as a configuration option. An Action returns a true or false exit code, which can be used (or ignored) in the Workflow’s execution. Hop A Hop links Actions in a Workflow or Transforms in a Pipeline. In Workflows, Hops operate based on the exit status of previous Actions, Hops in Pipelines pass data between Transforms. Pipeline Pipelines are the actual data workers. Operations in a Pipeline read, modify, enrich, clean and write data. Orchestration of Pipelines is done through othere Pipelines and/or Workflows. Transform A Transform is a unit of work performed in a Pipeline. Typical Transform operations are reading data from files, databases, performing lookups or joins, enriching, cleaning data and more. All transforms in a Pipeline are executed in parallel. Transforms process data and move batches of processed data on Hops for processing by subsequent Actions. Workflow A Workflow is a sequence of operations that are performed sequentially by default (with optional parallel execution). Workflows usually do not operate on the data directly, but perform orchestration tasks. Typical tasks in a Workflow consist of retrieving and archiving data, sending emails, error handling etc. ) Project Hop Projects are a conceptual grouping of configurations, variables, metadata objects and workflows and pipelines. Projects can inherit metadata from parent projects. A project contains one or more environments where the actual configuration is defined. Example: a 'Sales' project contains a 'customers' database connection and a number of workflows and pipelines. The runtime configurations, database connection properties etc are defined in the 'dev', 'uat' and 'prd' environments. Environment Hop Environments are instances of projects that hold the actual runtime configurations and other metadata objects for a project. Example: the 'dev' environment for the 'Sales' project specifies to read from host '10.0.0.1' for the 'customers' database connection","title":"Hop Concepts","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"hop-concepts","url":"/manual/latest/getting-started/hop-concepts.html","titles":[{"text":"Core Concepts","hash":"_core_concepts","id":1},{"text":"Item types","hash":"_item_types","id":2},{"text":"Projects and Environments","hash":"_projects_and_environments","id":3}]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"Hop is designed to be as easy and accessible to use as possible.

Let’s remember: A pipeline consists of a chain of transforms that read, process or write data. Transforms are connected by hops. Hops have a direction but can’t create loops, which effectively makes Pipelines DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs). A transform is each basic operation in your pipeline. Each transform performs an operation on the data: reads from a source, operates on data in the pipeline or writes to to a target. A hop in a pipeline passes data between transforms.

Creating a hop is identical to creating a hop in a pipeline: shift-drag: while holding down the shift key on your keyboard. Click on an action, while holding down your primary mouse button, drag to the second action. Release the primary mouse button and the shift key. scroll-drag: scroll-click on an action , while holding down your mouse’s scroll button, drag to the second action. Release the scroll button. click on an action in your pipeline to open the 'click anywhere' dialog. Click the 'Create hop' button and select the action you want to create the hop to. Save your workflow: At first, we have the Workflow run configuration session. A Workflow Run Configuration is a metadata object in Apache Hop and defines where the workflow is executed. Select the 'local' workflow runtime configuration that is available by default in your Hop installation and click 'Launch'. You’ll now have an execution results pane very similar to the pipeline execution results.","title":"Workflows","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"hop-gui-workflows","url":"/manual/latest/getting-started/hop-gui-workflows.html","titles":[{"text":"Create a Workflow","hash":"_create_a_workflow","id":1},{"text":"Add and connect actions","hash":"_add_and_connect_actions","id":2},{"text":"Add Actions","hash":"_add_actions","id":3},{"text":"Create a hop","hash":"_create_a_hop","id":4}]},"17":{"id":17,"text":"The Apache Hop GUI is your local development environment to build, run, preview and debug workflows and pipelines.

Hop lets you focus on the problem you’re trying to solve without technology getting in the way. Simple tasks should be easy, complex tasks need to be possible. Hop allows data professionals to work visually, using metadata to describe how data should be processed. Visual design enables data developers to focus on what they want to do instead of how that task needs to be done. This focus on the task at hand lets Hop developers be more productive than they would be when writing code. Hop was designed to be as flexible as possible: at the core is the small but powerful Hop engine. All functionality is added through plugins: the default Hop installation comes with about 400 plugins. You can remove or add third-party plugins according to your needs to tailor Hop to be exactly what you need. Hop is designed to work in any scenario, from IoT to huge volumes of data, on-prem, in the cloud, on a bare OS or in containers and kubernetes. Hop developers create workflows and pipelines in a visual development environment called Hop Gui. These workflows and pipelines can be executed on a variety of engines: workflows and pipelines can run on the native Hop engine, both locally and remotely. Pipelines can also run on Apache Spark, Apache Flink and Google Dataflow through the Apache Beam runtime configurations. In workflows and pipelines, hundreds of operations can be applied on the data: read from and write to a variety of source and target platforms, but also combine, enrich, clean and in many other ways manipulate data. Depending on the engine and selected functionality, your data can be processed in batch, streaming or in a batch/streaming hybrid. A number of common use cases for Hop are: Loading large data sets into databases taking advantage of the cloud, clustered, and massively parallel processing environments. Data warehouse population with built-in support for Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD), Change Data Capture (CDC), and surrogate key creation. Integrate between diverse data architectures, combining relational databases, files, NoSQL databases like Neo4j, MongoDB, Cassandra etc Data migration between different databases and applications.

Preview View output: view output of this transform in a running or finished pipeline. Preview output: execute the pipeline and see the output of this transform Debug output: execute the pipeline and debug the output of this transform. Execution will pause when the debugging conditions are met. Sniff output: take a look at 50 rows of output from the selected transform in a running pipeline Add data probe: streams the output rows of this transform to a pipeline defined in a pipeline probe. Logging Edit Custom Logging: set a custom logging level for the current transform Clear Custom Logging: reset the logging level for this transform back to Basic Unit Testing Unit testing: create an empty data set with the output fields and layout for this transform Write rows to data set: run the current pipeline and write the output of the current transform to a data set. The options shown for Unit Testing are just a subset of the available options. Check the unit testing docs for a detailed explanation of all the unit testing options. Click on a transform icon to open the popup dialog. Click on the transform name to directly open the transform properties. This is a shortcut to clicking on the icon and selecting Edit from the popup dialog. The Hop options, available from both the workflow and pipeline editors, offer a number of operations you can perform on one or more hops. For pipelines, the dialog offers the following options: Basic disable/enable hop: enable the current hop (if disabled) or disable the current hop (if enabled). This option will only show the applicable options (e.g. 'enable hop' won’t be shown for active hops and vice versa) delete hop: delete the current hop Bulk Enable downstream hops: enable the current hop, and all hops that follow later in the workflow (or pipeline). Disable downstream hops: disable the current hop and all hops that follow later in the current workflow (or pipeline). When working in a workflow, the hops popup dialog has all the options as the pipeline hop dialog, with one additional category: Routing Unconditional hop: make the current hop unconditional (ignore the result of the previous action and follow this hop anyway) Success hop: make the current hop a success hop (only follow if the result of the previous action is 'success') Failure hop: make the current hop a failure hop (only follow if the result of the previous action is 'failure')","title":"Hop Gui Popup (Context) Dialog","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"hop-gui-popup-dialog","url":"/manual/latest/hop-gui/hop-gui-popup-dialog.html","titles":[{"text":"Creating Items","hash":"_creating_items","id":1},{"text":"Workflow Options","hash":"_workflow_options","id":2},{"text":"Workflow Action Options","hash":"_workflow_action_options","id":3},{"text":"Pipeline Options","hash":"_pipeline_options","id":4},{"text":"Pipeline Transform Options","hash":"_pipeline_transform_options","id":5},{"text":"Hop Options","hash":"_hop_options","id":6}]},"25":{"id":25,"text":"Hop Web is a web-based Hop Gui version. It uses code conversion to translate the default Hop Gui desktop application to a web-based version. Even though not perfect, Hop Web provides the default Hop Gui user experience in a browser.

This continously updated docker image is by far the easiest way to try out Hop Web: Pull the latest build with: docker pull apache/hop-web. Once the image has been pulled, start Hop Web with docker run -p 8080:8080 apache/hop-web:latest The Hop Web container should only take a couple of seconds to start.

The perspective allows you to browse the list of executions and drill up or down to parent or child workflows and/or pipelines. Additionally, this perspective provides information about the execution status, logging information, (pipeline) metrics and the profiled data. The execution information displayed in this perspective is not collected automatically. You need to specify to which location you want to send execution information in the Pipeline run configuration or Workflow run configuration of your choice. You can navigate to it by clicking the icon from the vertical perspective toolbar in the Hop GUI. The Keyboard shortcut to do the same is: CTRL-Shift-I. If you want to view information regarding the last execution of the currently loaded pipeline (from the data orchestration perspective), you can hit the location icon in the toolbar: If you’re editing a workflow you can do the same: The left-hand side panel of the perspective contains a tree with all the defined Execution Information Location metadata elements. Below the names of these locations you’ll see the icon, name and registration date of the pipelines and workflow for which there is information. For example: Possible action: Action Result Double-click on a listed execution The information about the pipeline or workflow will be loaded into a new tab on the right-hand side of the perspective. Click on the refresh icon The last 100 executions without parent will be loaded from the location Click on the delete icon The currently selected execution will be deleted or all executions from the currently selected location (after confirmation). On the right side are the executions opened in different tabs. For example, here is a single execution information tab of a completed workflow: At the bottom you have different tabs: Tab Description Info Here you’ll find general information regarding the pipeline or workflow you’re looking at Metrics In case you’re examining a pipeline execution you can see the overall transform metrics if there are any. Log Here you can find the pipeline or workflow logging text. The logging text is loaded lazily when the tab is selected. The first part of the log is shown up to the limit specified in the configuration perspective under the option Maximum execution logging text size which is specified in number of characters. Data During the execution of a pipeline or workflow Hop can capture all sorts of data. Which data depends on the type of work that is being done and on how capturing is configured. For example the amount of data captured depends on the Execution Data Profile you set for a pipeline or whether of not there was interesting information after the execution of an action. If you click on a transform or workflow icon the perspective will automatically try to load all the data it has for it. It will switch to the \"Data\" tab at the bottom. There you will find a list of data sets that you can look at. Here are available data sets for workflow actions: Data set Description Result details of action You will find out if there were any errors, what the result (true/false) was or whether the action was stopped. Result files of action If the action result contains any file names they will be in this data set Result rows of action If the action result contains any rows they will be in this data set Variables before execution The list of interesting (different from the start of the workflow) variables before the action was executed. Variables after execution The list of interesting variables (and their values) after the action was executed. Here are some data sets you can capture in workflow transforms using an Execution Data Profile: Data set Description First rows of …​ Shows the first rows that were written by the transform. Last rows of …​ Shows the last rows that were written by the transform. Random rows of …​ Shows a random selection of rows written by the transform Data profiling data sets Depending on the data profiling options you enabled you can find per-column statistical information as well as sample rows.

If this is a workflow or pipeline it will be opened in the data orchestration perspective. In all other cases the file will be opened in a new tab. If the git plugin (folder plugins/misc/git) is installed, the file explorer will look for a .git/config file in the project home folder. It this exists the explorer perspective will start to color code the files listed: red: the file has not been added to git (un-staged). blue: the file has been changed (staged). gray: the file is ignored by git.

Instead of getting immediate results from a pipeline with a Web Service call, the only thing that is given back after the call in the unique ID of the executing workflow. With that unique ID you can query the status of the workflow. You can specify additional variables to report back during the querying of the status of the asynchronously running workflow. Check the Asynchronous Web Service metadata type for more information on how to configure the async web service. Here is the lifecycle: Executing an asynchronous web service is done by calling method hop/asyncRun with the main parameter being the name of the asynchronous web service. (service=) The response will be a JSON document which includes the ID of the workflow. Any other parameters will be considered to be variables or parameters of the workflow and are set in the underlying workflow. You can choose the workflow run configuration to use for the execution with the runConfig parameter. Please note that the more advanced features, like tracking of the progress of a running pipeline, are only available on a Local workflow engine. You can also POST content to the web service which can be set as a variable in the executing workflow. See the \"Content variable\" option below. In the following example we execute service dataload with parameter MAX set to 50M. The content of JSON file document.json is posted to the service. The result of the call is stored in file async-run.json: curl -v \\ --user cluster:cluster \\ --request POST \\ -o async-run.json \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ --data-binary '@document.json' \\ 'http://localhost:8282/hop/asyncRun/?service=dataload&MAX=50000000' You can call method hop/asyncStatus with as arguments the service name and ID of the executing workflow: hop/asyncStatus?service=&id=. The variables that are specified in the web service will be included in the JSON output of the service. You can also include the execution status of one or more pipelines. You can mark a pipeline action using the action: Enable Async Logging. You’ll be asked the name of the web service to report to. Using the output of the previous command you can execute the following command to query the status of the workflow from a command line: ID=$(cat async-run.json | sed 's/^.*\"id\":\"//g' | sed 's/\"}$//g') && \\ curl --user cluster:cluster \\ --request GET \\ -o - \\ 'http://localhost:8282/hop/asyncStatus/?service=dataload&id='$ID The ID of the executing asynchronous web service is the same as the \"container ID\" of the executing workflow. This means you can query the workflow itself as well with the hop/getWorkflowStatus service. The output of that service can be given in HTML (default), XML (parameter &xml=Y) or JSON (parameter &json=Y).

This is provided for by the 'projects' plugin. -gs --general-status List the general status of the server. -ps --pipeline-status List the status of the pipeline with this name (also specify the -id option) -ws --workflow-status List the status of the workflow with this name (also specify the -id option) -id Specify the ID of the pipeline or workflow to query Hop Server can be started with hostname or ip address and port number as unnamed arguments: Example: hop-server.sh 0.0.0.0 8080 Example: hop-server.bat 192.168.1.221 8081 Example: hop-server.sh -e aura-gcp gs://apachehop/hop-server-config.xml Example: hop-server.bat 127.0.0.1 8080 --kill --userName cluster --password cluster hop-server [ShutdownPort] [-h] [-p ] [-s] [-u ] Example startup commands are: Windows Linux, macOS hop-server.bat 127.0.0.1 8080 hop-server.bat 192.168.1.221 8081 hop-server.sh 127.0.0.1 8080 hop-server.sh 192.168.1.221 8081 Listen to all interfaces on the server: hop-server.sh 0.0.0.0 8080-- Specify the xml configuration file as the only argument: hop-server The syntax of this configuration file is fairly simple: server-8181 localhost 8181 8182 true 0 1440 1440 Example startup commands with a configuration file are: Windows Linux, macOS hop-server.bat C:\\\\hop-server-config.xml Or with a remote configuration file: hop-server.bat http://www.example.com/hop-server-config.xml You can also enable a project lifecyfle environment for the Hop server: hop-server.bat -e graph-aws hop-server.xml hop-server.sh /foo/bar/hop-server-config.xml Or with a remote configuration file: hop-server.sh http://www.example.com/hop-server-config.xml You can also enable a project lifecyfle environment for the Hop server: hop-server.sh -e graph-aws hop-server.xml In the sample above the environment contains configuration files with variables which are loaded. With the environment the server also knows the project home folder. The server configuration file is found in the home folder automatically with the implicit relative path. To protect traffic between a Hop Server and its clients (Hop Run, Hop GUI, a browser, Hop Server command line querying, …​) it’s possible to use encrypt data using a secure socket layer (SSL) connection on top of the regular web traffic with a hyper treading transfer protocol (HTTP). The combination of both is called HTTPS. To run a Hop server using this https:// protocol you can add an sslConfig section in the hop-server-config/hop-server path. The 3 main options are: keyStore : the path to the java keystore file, created with keytool keyStorePassword : the password to the keystore file keyPassword : the key password. If this is the same as the keystore password you can omit this option. The HTTP protocol used is version 1.1 or HTTP/1.1. The type of keystore read is a Java Keystore or type: JKS. Let’s take a look at how we can generate a sample keystore: # Generate a new key # openssl genrsa -des3 -out hop.key # Make a new certificate # openssl req -new -x509 -key hop.key -out hop.crt # Create a PKCS12 keystore and import it into a JKS keystore # The resulting file is: keystore # keytool -keystore keystore -import -alias hop -file hop.crt -trustcacerts openssl req -new -key hop.key -out hop.csr openssl pkcs12 -inkey hop.key -in hop.crt -export -out hop.pkcs12 keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore hop.pkcs12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore keystore Here is an example of the information to include in your server XML: ... /path/to/keystore password keyPassword Y ... Hop Server provides the -l or --level option to set a logging level for workflows and pipelines that run on the server. There are scenarios where you may want to see more detailed logging about the server itself. Since Hop Server runs on a Jetty server, you can increase the Jetty server logging by extending the HOP_OPTIONS variable near the end of hop-server.sh or hop-server.bat. Original: \"$_HOP_JAVA\" ${HOP_OPTIONS} -Djava.library.path=$LIBPATH -classpath \"${CLASSPATH}\" org.apache.hop.www.HopServer \"$@\" EXITCODE=$? With DEBUG logging: \"$_HOP_JAVA\" ${HOP_OPTIONS} -Dorg.eclipse.jetty.util.log.class=org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.StdErrLog -Dorg.eclipse.jetty.LEVEL=DEBUG -Djava.library.path=$LIBPATH -classpath \"${CLASSPATH}\" org.apache.hop.www.HopServer \"$@\" EXITCODE=$? If applied correctly, your Hop Server starts producing a lot of logging information similar to the lines below: 2022/07/15 14:18:00 - HopServer - Installing timer to purge stale objects after 1440 minutes. 2022-07-15 14:18:00.267:INFO::main: Logging initialized @3732ms to org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.StdErrLog 2022-07-15 14:18:00.276:DBUG:oejuc.ContainerLifeCycle:main: Server@3749c6ac{STOPPED}[9.4.35.v20201120] added {QueuedThreadPool[qtp1195781551]@47462daf{STOPPED,8[{o.e.j.s.ServletContextHandler@1a6df932{/,null,STOPPED},[o.e.j.s.ServletContextHandler@1a6df932{/,null,STOPPED}]}] 2022-07-15 14:18:00.303:DBUG:oejuc.ContainerLifeCycle:main: ContextHandlerCollection@74120029{STOPPED} added {o.e.j.s.ServletContextHandler@1a6df932{/,null,STOPPED},AUTO} 2022-07-15 14:18:00.304:DBUG:oeju.DecoratedObjectFactory:main: Adding Decorator: org.eclipse.jetty.util.DeprecationWarning@48cbb4c5 It’s often very convenient to run a Hop docker container since it has all the required software automatically delivered. For a complete description of the standard Hop docker container see the full reference in the technical documentation. Here is an example of how you would start a \"long-lived\" docker container: docker run \\ -p 8080:8080 \\ -p 8079:8079 \\ -e HOP_SERVER_PORT=8080 \\ -e HOP_SERVER_SHUTDOWNPORT=8079 \\ -e HOP_SERVER_USER=username \\ -e HOP_SERVER_PASS=password \\ apache/hop In a testing setup where Hop Server was started from a terminal, the process can be terminated through CTRL-C. In headless environments, the same hop-server command used to start the server can be used to stop it: A default listener on shutdown port is configured on port number 8079 when not specifying this in the command it will be used. Windows Linux, macOS hop-server.bat 127.0.0.1 8080 -k -u cluster -p cluster hop-server.sh 127.0.0.1 8080 -k -u cluster -p cluster You can also trigger the command on a specific shutdown port Windows Linux, macOS hop-server.bat 127.0.0.1 8080 8079 -k -u cluster -p cluster hop-server.sh 127.0.0.1 8080 8079 -k -u cluster -p cluster Starting a Hop Server on the local machine e.g. on port 8081 will only take 1 or 2 seconds. The console output will look similar to what is listed below: 2020/06/20 18:35:12 - HopServer - Installing timer to purge stale objects after 1440 minutes. 2020/06/20 18:35:12 - HopServer - Created listener for webserver @ address : localhost:8081 You can query the new server with another hop-server command: Windows Linux, macOS hop-server.bat -gs -u cluster -p cluster 127.0.0.1 8080 Expected output: C:\\\\hop>echo off ===[Environment Settings - hop-server.bat]==================================== Java identified as \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\jdk-11.0.17.8-hotspot\\\\bin\\java\" HOP_OPTIONS=-Xmx2048m -DHOP_AUDIT_FOLDER=.\\audit -DHOP_PLATFORM_OS=Windows -DHOP_PLATFORM_RUNTIME=GUI -DHOP_AUTO_CREATE_CONFIG=Y Command to start Hop will be: \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\jdk-11.0.17.8-hotspot\\\\bin\\java\" -classpath lib\\core\\*;lib\\beam\\*;lib\\swt\\win64\\* -Djava.library.path=lib\\core;lib\\beam -Xmx2048m -DHOP_AUDIT_FOLDER=.\\audit -DHOP_PLATFORM_OS=Windows -DHOP_PLATFORM_RUNTIME=GUI -DHOP_AUTO_CREATE_CONFIG=Y org.apache.hop.www.HopServer -gs -u cluster -p cluster localhost 8181 ===[Starting HopServer]========================================================= 2022/12/16 14:02:13 - HopServer - Enabling project 'default' Pipelines: 0 found.

You’ll be prompted for your username and password. The default is cluster for both the username and password. The defaults obviously should be changed in any environment that goes beyond a simple local developer setup. on startup, the pipeline and workflow lists shown below will be empty. Run a workflow or pipeline through the Hop Remote pipeline engine run configuration or through the REST api. When pipelines or workflows are executed on the server, you’ll be able to follow the logging output either from the terminal or a log file (e.g. piped from the startup command).

Your Hop Server needs to know about the metadata you defined. As stated above you need to make sure the server has access to the pipeline(s) you want to execute as well as the server metadata. The best way to do this is to set the following option in your XML configuration file: Linux /path/to/your/metadata Windows C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\your\\\\metadata A simple example would be: 8181 localhost 8181 /home/hop/project/services/metadata http:///hop/webService Parameter Description service The name of the service.

The content of this body is then picked up if you set the request body content variable. This variable will contain the body content every time the POST request triggers the execution of the underlying pipeline. The following executes Hop Web Service test as seen in the screenshot above.

The tool is not only excellently suited for these classic data warehouse tasks or for database migrations. In the context of low-code software development, Apache Hop can also be used to provide fast calculations and data queries as a web service without much programming effort and to link these calculations to your own web services. Hundreds of lines of source code are eliminated, as the functionality can be conveniently implemented as a pipeline with its dozens of transforms (processing steps) in the Apache HOP UI and integrated as a web service. The following illustration shows an example of where Apache HOP can be integrated with web services in a full-stack architecture (multi-container application). In order to call the created Hop web services from a Java application, for example, the Apache Hop server on which the pipelines are executed is required. The Hop server provides a web interface (servlet) to return the results of the execution. It can be run on a dedicated server or inside a Docker container. The latter option offers the advantage of scaling quickly when needed. This guide covers the steps to create an example web service and subsequent deployment in a Docker container. The task of the fictitious example web service in this tutorial is to provide data in real time for a project dashboard (specifically: the number of active/inactive teams per team type), so that after processing in the API layer, the data can be displayed in the frontend as a stacked bar chart. The data is available in normalised form in the database and must first be prepared by the web service. After creating the project and setting up the database connection in HOP, the following pipeline is created (file name: countTeams.hpl): The pipeline expects a project ID as an input parameter in order to be able to read out the teams belonging to the project from the database. The data is grouped, then the number is calculated and finally denormalised by team type. The result of the execution should be returned in JSON format. To make the pipeline available as a web service, metadata must be created for it and later made known to the Hop server. The use of metadata has the advantage that the calling application only needs to know the web service name, the details of the underlying implementation (especially the location of the pipeline) remain hidden. The following metadata are created for the pipeline under the Web Service tab: The Name field contains the name of the web service under which the calling application will call the service. The Filename field contains the assignment to the storage location of the pipeline. The Output transform field contains the name of the transform that provides the result in the output field to be specified. Content type specifies the output format of the return stream. In addition, you can further specify in the metadata whether the web service should be disabled (Enabled?) and whether the status of the execution should be listed in the statistics of the web server UI. In the pipeline listed above, the content of the output field outputValue of the Transform JSON Output is to be returned as the result: After saving the metadata, everything is ready to run the web service in a Docker container. In Apache Hop it is possible to set up runtime environments for different environments (e.g. Development Local, Docker Single, Docker Multi-App) via so-called configurations and to pass them to the pipeline without having to adapt or duplicate the pipeline itself (e.g. one pipeline for each environment). Connection details (e.g. DB server URL) for database connections, etc. can be stored as variables in configuration files. For example, to set up a new database connection whose connection details may differ depending on the environment, enter the name of the environment variable (e.g. ${DB_HOST}) instead of a concrete server URL. As soon as you select an environment and the variable is contained in its configuration file, the variable in the DB configuration is replaced by the value from the environment configuration. This functionality is very helpful, for example, to test the pipeline against different environments before you start the deployment on the Hop Server. This functionality is also essential for multi-container applications (see above: full-stack architecture), whose service results from the interaction of different and externally isolated containers. A separate environment configuration is therefore necessary if you want to start your application with Docker Compose in addition to your development environment (in this example, the ${DB_HOST} variable would have the service name of the DB Container instead of the IP address of the DB Server). To start the Hop Server inside a Docker container, you have the following options for building the container: Using the image provided by Apache Hop Use the Apache Hop image as a starting image and add application-specific customisations in the form of a new image (e.g. include the Hop project with its workflows and pipelines as well as third-party APIs). Creation of a complete custom image (possibly based on the DOCKERFILES provided in the Apache Hop Github repository). Depending on the deployment strategy, it may be advisable to include the project and its source code in the image, e.g. if only containers may be deployed in a production environment. The first option is sufficient for this guide, as all adjustments can be transferred to the Docker container via environment variables for the example. In addition, changes to pipelines should be made visible immediately without having to rebuild the image first. For this purpose, it is necessary to mount the location of the project (incl. subdirectories for JDBC drivers and the metadata configuration) into the Docker container. First download the Docker image: docker pull apache/hop: Example: docker pull apache/hop:1.1.0-SNAPSHOT To execute the containers afterwards, the following environment variables or parameters must be set as a minimum: Variable/Docker Parameter Example value Description HOP_SERVER_USER admin Admin user to log in to the UI of the Hop Server HOP_SERVER_PASS admin Password for logging into the UI of the Hop Server HOP_SERVER_PORT 8182 Port of the server (internal) HOP_SERVER_HOSTNAME 0.0.0.0 Docker internal IP address of the host HOP_PROJECT_NAME Proj1 When the container is created, a project with all necessary configurations is initially created, therefore the project to be specified serves as a placeholder. HOP_PROJECT_FOLDER /files Root folder containing the project HOP_ENVIRONMENT_NAME Local Name of the environment with which the container is to be started (e.g. local, prod) - see step 3 HOP_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG_FILE_NAME_PATHS /files/config/localTestConfig.json Comma separated list of all environment files (see step 3) HOP_SERVER_METADATA_FOLDER /files/metadata Directory containing the metadata information (in this case, the metadata associated with the web service). HOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDERS /files/jdbc Directory containing all required JDBC drivers (e.g. for MySQL, Oracle) that are not included in the standard delivery. This is a comma separated list defaulting to lib/jdbc p 8182:8182 Mapping of the internal Docker port to the port of the Docker host V /my/path/to/location:/files Mount path and mapping to a Docker internal path Name Name of the Docker container In the technical documentation for Apache HOP running as Docker Container (pls see docs), further parameters are listed (e.g. when using SSL), which have been omitted here for simplification. Example call: docker run -it --rm \\ --env HOP_SERVER_USER=admin \\ --env HOP_SERVER_PASS=admin \\ --env HOP_SERVER_PORT=8182 \\ --env HOP_SERVER_HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 \\ --env HOP_PROJECT_NAME=proj1 \\ --env HOP_PROJECT_FOLDER=/files \\ --env HOP_ENVIRONMENT_NAME=Local \\ --env HOP_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG_FILE_NAME_PATHS=/files/config/localTestConfig.json \\ --env HOP_SERVER_METADATA_FOLDER=/files/metadata \\ --env HOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDERS=/files/jdbc \\ -p 8182:8182 \\ -v /my/path/to/location:/files \\ --name test-hop-container \\ apache/hop:1.1.0-SNAPSHOT If the container has been started successfully, the web server GUI can be opened via http://:/hop/status/ which gives an overview of the pipelines and workflows called up after logging in (using the administrator IDs passed). To call a web service with the name , the following request is necessary: +http://:/hop/webService?service=&Param1=Value&Param2=Value2…​. The WebService countTeams from this tutorial expects the parameter PARAM_PROJECT_ID. The call is made as follows: +http://localhost:8182/hop/webService/?service=countTeams&PARAM_PROJECT_ID=63 As mentioned at the beginning of the tutorial, the API layer above can now process the JSON output and pass it to the front end, which then uses the processed data to create the chart. Apache Hop Pipelines as web services are easy to set up via meta-data configurations and can be easily deployed via Docker. They are suitable everywhere to synchronously return results quickly that do not require a long processing time. As of version 1.1, Apache Hop also supports the use of workflows as web services. Here, the call is asynchronous, i.e. when the service is called, a unique ID of the workflow to be executed is returned immediately and the execution starts in the background on the HOP server (for details check the docs).","title":"Web Services in Apache Hop","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"apache-hop-web-services-docker","url":"/manual/latest/how-to-guides/apache-hop-web-services-docker.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Running Pipelines as a Web services in a Docker container","hash":"_running_pipelines_as_a_web_services_in_a_docker_container","id":2},{"text":"Step 0: Requirements for the web service","hash":"_step_0_requirements_for_the_web_service","id":3},{"text":"Step 1: Creation of the pipeline","hash":"_step_1_creation_of_the_pipeline","id":4},{"text":"Step 2: Meta Data Configuration","hash":"_step_2_meta_data_configuration","id":5},{"text":"Step 3: Set up configurations for different runtime environments","hash":"_step_3_set_up_configurations_for_different_runtime_environments","id":6},{"text":"Step 4: Set up and start Docker Container","hash":"_step_4_set_up_and_start_docker_container","id":7},{"text":"Step 5: Call Web Service","hash":"_step_5_call_web_service","id":8},{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"_conclusion","id":9}]},"50":{"id":50,"text":"This page contains a collection of how-to guides to perform a variety of tasks, configurations etc with Apache Hop.

This guide explains the differences between the various joins and lookups, and will help you to choose the right transform for your pipelines. Joins are a way to merge data from two or more different streams in your pipeline. Joins typically require you to select a set of fields (the join keys) to join the streams on. The data in all streams that are involved in the join needs to be sorted on the join keys. Depending on the transform you use and the configuration options you specify, joins can change the amount of data you’re processing in both way. For example, an inner Merge join with a limited number of matches between the keys in both streams can significantly reduce the number of rows in your stream. A Join Rows (Cartesian Product) on the other hand can result in an explosion of the number of rows you started the pipeline with. Multiple streams in your pipeline that have the exact same layout (identical fields, identical data types, identical order) can be joined or merged without the need for a transform. Just create a hop from the last transform in two or more substreams to a target transform. Hop Gui will complain if there are differences in the layout of the streams you’re combining. The available join transforms are: Transform When to use Join Rows (Cartesian Product) produce combinations (Cartesian product) of all rows in the input streams situations where you want to create a combination of all data in one stream with all data in another example: you want to create a copy of a data set for all members in a team, a list of available months or similar. WARN: Use with care on large volumes of data. The combination of all data in both streams easily become huge. Merge Join classic merge join between data sets with data coming from two different input transforms You want to combine data from two different streams based on a matching key in both streams, and want to continue working with (a selection of) the combined data from both streams. example: a subset of your data is available in files, another subset is available in a database table. Both the file have a matching key (e.g an ID) that you can use to combine both sets. Merge Rows (diff) compares and merges data within two rows of data, adding a field indicator for each row You have two sets of data with the same layout. You want to compare both data sets and identify which lines in one set a new, identical, changed or deleted compared to the other data set. example*: you receive a daily file that needs to be processed. Compare today’s file with yesterday’s file, so you can ignore the identical data and only process the changes. Multiway merge join joins input data from multiple streams Join data from multiple (typically more than two) streams, similar to merge join. This transform provides a shortcut to what you otherwise would do by chaining multiple merge joins after each other. example: you receive data from files, a database query and a REST api. All three streams have one or more corresponding keys to join data from the various streams. XML Join adds xml tags from one stream into a leading XML structure from a second stream You need to build XML files from various data sources and with multiple nested elements. This transform is atypical in the sense that you’re performing joins to build output instead of the other join transforms that combine incoming data for further processing. example: you’re building complex XML output files. Database join allows you to run a query against a database using data obtained from previous transforms The database join executes a (parameterized) SQL query for every row you execute. While this transform gives you unparallelled flexibility, it performs a database query for every single row, so it is a potential performance bottleneck. example: You need to fetch information that can’t be retrieved from a single table and requires a query that fetches data from multiple tables. Lookups are a way to let you enrich your pipeline’s stream with additional fields from external sources. The transforms allow you to choose which additional fields will be retrieved from the lookup source. Contrary to joins, lookups work on the current pipeline stream and your never change the number of rows you’re processing. There are a number of transforms in the Lookup category that are considered self-explanatory in a lookup context and won’t be included here. These transforms are: Call DB Procedure Check if file is locked Column exists Dynamic SQL row File exists Fuzzy match Get server status HTTP client HTTP post REST client Table exists Web services lookup Transform When to use Combination lookup/update allows you to store information in a junk-dimension table. The transform can possibly also be used to maintain Kimball pure Type 1 dimensions. in a lookup context, this transform gets data from a type 1 slowly changing dimension. Dimension lookup/update allows you to implement Ralph Kimball’s slowly changing dimension for both types: Type I (update) and Type II (insert) together with some additional functions. This transform can be used to populate a dimension table or to look up values in a slowly changing dimension without making any changes. In a lookup context, this transform lets you perform lookups in a type 2 slowly changing dimension. In a lookup context, you typically use the natural keys and date or timestamp for your data to retrieve the surrogate key for the correct version of the data in a dimension. Uncheck the Update the dimension checkbox to use the transform as a lookup and to prevent it from updating the dimension table. example: you want to retrieve the correct surrogate key for a dimension record in a slowly changing customer table in your data warehouse. Database lookup allows you to look up values in a database table. Lookup values are added as new fields onto the stream. You need to retrieve additional information from a single database table, based on fields in your pipeline stream. example: you’re processing data that contains a customer’s id. You also need the customer’s name and location, which is available in a database table. Stream lookup allows you to look up data using information coming from other transforms in the pipeline. The data coming from the Source transform is first read into memory and is then used to look up data from the main stream. use the Stream lookup when you need to perform a lot of lookups on a fairly limited set of data. The performance benefit of performing lookups from memory comes with the limitation of the available memory. The stream lookup accepts data from any pipeline stream, but since the data needs to be loaded into memory before the pipeline starts, consider your available memory resources the memory footprint for your Stream lookup’s input before adding it to your pipeline. In the default Hop configuration with 2 GB of memory, a couple of megabytes is fine, a 20GB CSV file as Stream lookup input isn’t. example you need to process a large dataset that contains product prices in a number of different currencies. You received a list of historical conversion rates for the last month in a csv file. This lookup file is about 5000 lines, loading it into memory an picking up the right conversion rate with a Stream lookup transform allows you to perform lightning fast lookups. The Combination lookup/update, Dimension lookup/update and Database lookup allow you to cache data. Cached data is stored in memory to speed up the lookup process. The dialog options vary slightly, but the caching options offered by these transforms are: enable cache? (boolean): switches caching on or off cache size: the size (number of rows) to cache in memory pre-load cache: load data in the cache before the pipeline starts load all data from table (database lookup only): load all the table’s data to memory before the pipeline starts. Consider your available memory resources when configuring caching. Caching can significantly speed up the lookup process, but memory is a finite resource.","title":"","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"joins-lookups","url":"/manual/latest/how-to-guides/joins-lookups.html","titles":[{"text":"Joins and lookups","hash":"JoinsLookups","id":1},{"text":"Joins","hash":"_joins","id":2},{"text":"Lookups","hash":"_lookups","id":3},{"text":"Lookup Caching","hash":"_lookup_caching","id":4}]},"52":{"id":52,"text":"After your project has gone through the initial development and testing, knowing what is going on in runtime becomes important. The Apache Hop Pipeline Log allows the logging of the activity of a pipeline with another pipeline. A Pipeline Log streams logging information from a running pipeline to another pipeline. The Pipeline Log will be created in JSON format. Hop will pass the logging information for each pipeline you run to the pipeline(s) you specify as pipeline log metadata objects. In this post, we’ll look at an example of how to configure and use the pipeline log metadata to write pipeline logging information to a relational database. The examples here are provided we use variables to separate code and configuration according to best practices in your Apache Hop projects. To create a Pipeline Log click on the New → Pipeline Log option or click on the Metadata → Pipeline Log option. The system displays the New Pipeline Log view with the following fields to be configured. The Pipeline Log can be configured as in the following example: Name: the name of the metadata object (pipelines-logging). Enabled: (checked). Pipeline executed to capture logging: select or create the pipeline to process the logging information for this Pipeline Log (${PROJECT_HOME}/hop/logging/pipelines-logging.hpl). Next, select or create the pipeline to be used for logging the activity. We’ll create a pipeline soon, important to note is that you can use all the functionality in Apache Hop pipeline to work with the logging data. The only prerequisite is that the first transform in this pipeline needs to start with a pipeline logging transform. Execute at the start of the pipeline?: (checked). Execute at the end of the pipeline?: (checked). Execute periodically during execution?: (unchecked) Finally, save the Pipeline Log configuration. pipeline logging will apply to any pipeline you run in the current project. That may not be necessary or even not desired. If you want to only work with logging information for a selected number of pipelines, you can add a selection of pipelines to the table below the configuration options (\"Capture output of the following pipelines\"). The screenshot below shows the single \"generate-fake-books.hpl\" pipeline that logging will be captured for in the default Apache Hop samples project. To create the pipeline you can go to the perspective area or by clicking on the New button in the New Pipeline Log dialog. Then, choose a folder and a name for the pipeline. A new pipeline is automatically created with a Pipeline Logging transform connected to a Dummy transform (Save logging here). Now it’s time to configure the Pipeline Logging transform. This configuration is very simple, open the transform and set your values as in the following example: Transform name: choose a name for your transform, just remember that the name of the transform should be unique in your pipeline (log). Also log transform: selected by default. The Table Output transform allows you to load data into a database table. Table Output is equivalent to the DML operator INSERT. This transform provides configuration options for the target table and a lot of housekeeping and/or performance-related options such as Commit Size and Use batch update for inserts. In this example, we are going to use a relational database connection to log but you can also use output files. In case you decide to use a database connection, check the installation and availability as a pre-requirement. Add a Table Output transform by clicking anywhere in the pipeline canvas, then Search 'table output' → Table Output. Now it’s time to configure the Table Output transform. Open the transform and set your values as in the following example: Transform name: choose a name for your transform, just remember that the name of the transform should be unique in your pipeline (pipelines logging). Connection: The database connection to which data will be written (logging-connection). The connection was configured by using the logging-connection.json environment file that contains the variables: Target table: The name of the table to which data will be written (pipelines-logging). Click on the SQL option to generate the SQL to create the output table automatically: Execute the SQL statements: Open the created table in your favorite database explorer (e.g DBeaver) to see all the logging fields: Close and save the pipeline. Finally, run a pipeline by clicking on the Run → Launch option. In this case, we use a basic pipeline (generate-rows.hpl) that generates a constant and writes the 1000 rows to a CSV file: The data of the pipeline execution will be recorded in the pipelines-logging table. Check the data in the pipelines-logging table. You now know how to use the pipeline log metadata type to work with everything Apache Hop has to offer to process your pipeline logging information.

Let’s take a closer look at the different options. As stated in the section title, this option is deprecated and is only available in Apache Hop for historical reasons. DO NOT use this option in new development. It does work, but it’s a lot harder to figure out what is going on inside your pipelines or workflows. If you have this type of loops in your project e.g. as part of an imported Pentaho Data Integration (Kettle) project, have a look at the other ways to build loops in this guide to refactor those loops. In this scenario, you’ll need at least three Apache Hop files: in a first pipeline, we’ll build a list of values to loop over. These rows are placed in memory with a Copy rows to result transform. in a second pipeline, we’ll consume each of the values in the loop. Each value in the loop is accepted as a parameter in this pipeline. both pipelines are executed by a workflow. The first pipeline action puts the values to loop over in memory. In the second pipeline action, we’ll enable the Execute for every result row option and pass the fieldname(s) we copied to memory as a Stream column name as a parameter to the pipeline that processes the loop values. This is what that looks like in a very basic example: Create 10 rows with a counter to loop over. Copy these rows to memory. Process each of the values in the loop individually. This example receives the loop value as a $${PRM_COUNTER$} parameter and prints it to the logs. Both pipelines are executed from a workflow. The second pipeline action in this workflow runs the pipeline where we process the loop values. The Execute for every result row option runs this pipeline for every counter value we placed in memory in the first pipeline. The logs for this workflow will look similar to the output below: 2023/04/24 11:25:07 - Hop - Starting workflow 2023/04/24 11:25:07 - loops-process-rows-from-memory - Start of workflow execution 2023/04/24 11:25:07 - loops-process-rows-from-memory - Starting action [loops-copy-rows-to-result.hpl] 2023/04/24 11:25:07 - loops-copy-rows-to-result.hpl - Using run configuration [local] 2023/04/24 11:25:07 - loops-copy-rows-to-result - Executing this pipeline using the Local Pipeline Engine with run configuration 'local' 2023/04/24 11:25:07 - loops-copy-rows-to-result - Execution started for pipeline [loops-copy-rows-to-result] 2023/04/24 11:25:07 - generate 10 rows.0 - Finished processing (I=0, O=0, R=0, W=10, U=0, E=0) 2023/04/24 11:25:07 - add counter.0 - Finished processing (I=0, O=0, R=10, W=10, U=0, E=0) 2023/04/24 11:25:07 - Copy rows to result.0 - Finished processing (I=0, O=0, R=10, W=10, U=0, E=0) 2023/04/24 11:25:07 - loops-copy-rows-to-result - Pipeline duration : 0.052 seconds [ 0.052\" ] 2023/04/24 11:25:07 - loops-process-rows-from-memory - Starting action [loops-copy-rows-to-result-log-counter.hpl] ... ... 2023/04/24 11:25:07 - loops-copy-rows-to-result-log-counter - Executing this pipeline using the Local Pipeline Engine with run configuration 'local' 2023/04/24 11:25:07 - loops-copy-rows-to-result-log-counter - Execution started for pipeline [loops-copy-rows-to-result-log-counter] 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - generate 1 row.0 - Finished processing (I=0, O=0, R=0, W=1, U=0, E=0) 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - log ${PRM_COUNTER}.0 - 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - log ${PRM_COUNTER}.0 - ------------> Linenr 1------------------------------ 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - log ${PRM_COUNTER}.0 - ################################# 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - log ${PRM_COUNTER}.0 - the vaule for PRM_COUNTER is now 10 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - log ${PRM_COUNTER}.0 - ################################# 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - log ${PRM_COUNTER}.0 - 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - log ${PRM_COUNTER}.0 - 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - log ${PRM_COUNTER}.0 - 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - log ${PRM_COUNTER}.0 - ==================== 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - log ${PRM_COUNTER}.0 - Finished processing (I=0, O=0, R=1, W=1, U=0, E=0) 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - loops-copy-rows-to-result-log-counter - Pipeline duration : 0.035 seconds [ 0.035\" ] 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - loops-process-rows-from-memory - Finished action [loops-copy-rows-to-result-log-counter.hpl] (result=[true]) 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - loops-process-rows-from-memory - Finished action [loops-copy-rows-to-result.hpl] (result=[true]) 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - loops-process-rows-from-memory - Workflow execution finished 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - Hop - Workflow execution has ended 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - loops-process-rows-from-memory - Workflow duration : 0.65 seconds [ 0.650\" ] 2023/04/24 11:25:08 - loops-copy-rows-to-result-log-counter - Execution finished on a local pipeline engine with run configuration 'local' As you may have noticed, this way of looping is not very transparent. There is no way to pick up the stream values you want to pass to the second pipeline. You’ll need to log information to the logs if you want to have a clear view on what is happening in your loop. All of this combined makes it hard to maintain and debug this type of loops. The Workflow executor^ and Pipeline executor^ offer flexible and elegant ways to run workflows and pipelines from within an existing pipeline. The pipeline executor is a relatively simple but very powerful transform. Specify a name for the pipeline you want to execute (or accept the pipeline name from a field), specify a run configuration, map the child pipeline’s parameters to fields in your current pipeline, and done. The pipeline executor transform will send rows to the child pipeline one by one by default. This default behavior can be changed in the Row grouping tab. Use a Get rows from result^ transform in the child pipeline to fetch the rows if you’re sending more than one row to the child pipeline. Looping over a list of values to send to your child pipeline is not necessarily the last action you want to perform in your main pipeline. There are 5 possibilities to create hops from the pipeline executor transform to later transforms in the pipeline. This hop type returns execution results and metrics from the various child pipeline runs. It’s a good idea to at least check if there have been any issues in one of your child pipelines with the ExecutionResult, ExecutionExitStatus or ExecutionNrErrors fields. Fieldname Type Description ExecutionTime Integer the time it took to execute the child pipeline ExecutionResult Boolean the result of the child pipeline execution (Y/N) ExecutionNrErrors Integer the number of errors encountered in the child pipeline execution ExecutionLinesRead Integer number of lines read from previous transforms (in the child pipeline) ExecutionLinesWritten Integer number of lines written to following transforms (in the child pipeline) ExecutionLinesInput Integer number of lines read from physical I/O like files or databases ExecutionLinesOutput Integer number of lines written to physical I/O like files or databases ExecutionLinesRejected Integer number of rejected lines in the child pipeline ExecutionLinesUpdated Integer number of updated lines in the child pipeline ExecutionLinesDeleted Integer number of deleted lines in the child pipeline ExecutionFilesRetrieved Integer number of retrieved files in the child pipeline ExecutionExitStatus Integer exit status of the child pipeline ExecutionLogText String the full logging text for the child pipeline’s execution ExecutionLogChannelId String log channel id for the child pipeline’s execution This rowset receives data that was copied to memory by the child pipeline, e.g. with a Copy rows to result transform. Use the \"Result rows\" tab in the pipeline executor transform to specify which fields you expect to receive from the child pipelines. This rowset will contain any filename that was copied to the results, e.g. with the Add filenames to result in the Content tab of the Text file input^ transform. This rowset passes on the data stream as it was received by the pipeline executor transform. This rowset mimics the input for the pipeline executor transform. The workflow executor transform is similar to the pipeline executor transform but, as the name implies, lets you run workflows from within a pipeline. Specify a name for the workflow you want to execute, specify a run configuration, map the child workflow’s parameters to fields in your pipeline, and done. The workflow executor transform will send rows to the workflow one by one by default. This default behavior can be changed in the Row grouping tab. Again, similar to the pipeline executor transform, Looping over a list of values to send to your child workflow is not necessarily the last action you want to perform in your main pipeline. There are 4 possibilities to create hops from the workflow executor transform to later transforms in the pipeline. This hop type returns execution results and metrics from the various child workflow runs. It’s a good idea to at least check if there have been any issues in one of your child workflow runs with the ExecutionResult, ExecutionExitStatus or ExecutionNrErrors fields. Fieldname Type Description ExecutionTime Integer the time it took to execute the child workflow ExecutionResult Boolean the result of the child workflow execution (Y/N) ExecutionNrErrors Integer the number of errors encountered in the child workflow execution ExecutionLinesRead Integer number of lines read from previous transforms (in the child workflow) ExecutionLinesWritten Integer number of lines written to following transforms (in the child workflow) ExecutionLinesInput Integer number of lines read from physical I/O like files or databases ExecutionLinesOutput Integer number of lines written to physical I/O like files or databases ExecutionLinesRejected Integer number of rejected lines in the child workflow ExecutionLinesUpdated Integer number of updated lines in the child workflow ExecutionLinesDeleted Integer number of deleted lines in the child workflow ExecutionFilesRetrieved Integer number of retrieved files in the child workflow ExecutionExitStatus Integer exit status of the child workflow ExecutionLogText String the full logging text for the child workflow’s execution ExecutionLogChannelId String log channel id for the child workflow’s execution This rowset receives data that was copied to memory by the child workflow. Use the Result rows tab in the workflow executor transform to specify which fields you expect to receive from the child workflows. This rowset will contain any filename that was copied to the results by the child workflow. This rowset mimics the input for the workflow executor transform. In addition to the workflow and pipeline executor transforms, the Repeat^ and End Repeat^ actions let you build loops from a workflow. The repeat action in itself is pretty simple: it requires a workflow or pipeline and the run configuration to use. The action will continue to execute the specified workflow or pipeline until a condition is met: either a variable is set with an (optional) value, or an End repeat action is triggered in a child workflow. The example below runs a pipeline that increments a $${COUNTER$} variable with each run. If the variable values exceeds 10, a variable $${END_LOOP$} is set. This variable is detected by the Repeat action, and the loop stops. The options discussed here give you all the tools you need to build and run loops in your Apache Hop projects. All of the samples discussed here are available in the samples project that is available in your Apache Hop installation (as of Apache Hop 2.5.0). If you upgraded your projects from Pentaho Data Integration (Kettle) or intend to upgrade, now’s the time to refactor your deprecated Copy rows to result loops to any of the options discussed here.","title":"Loops in Apache Hop","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"loops-in-apache-hop","url":"/manual/latest/how-to-guides/loops-in-apache-hop.html","titles":[{"text":"DEPRECATED: copy rows to result + execute for each row","hash":"_deprecated_copy_rows_to_result_execute_for_each_row","id":1},{"text":"Pipeline and Workflow executor","hash":"_pipeline_and_workflow_executor","id":2},{"text":"Pipeline Executor","hash":"_pipeline_executor","id":3},{"text":"Pipeline Executor - execution results","hash":"_pipeline_executor_execution_results","id":4},{"text":"Pipeline Executor - Result rows after execution","hash":"_pipeline_executor_result_rows_after_execution","id":5},{"text":"Pipeline Executor - Result file names after execution","hash":"_pipeline_executor_result_file_names_after_execution","id":6},{"text":"Pipeline Executor - Copy of the executor transform’s input data","hash":"_pipeline_executor_copy_of_the_executor_transforms_input_data","id":7},{"text":"Pipeline Executor - Main output of the transform","hash":"_pipeline_executor_main_output_of_the_transform","id":8},{"text":"Workflow Executor","hash":"_workflow_executor","id":9},{"text":"Workflow Executor - Execution Results","hash":"_workflow_executor_execution_results","id":10},{"text":"Workflow Executor - Result rows after execution","hash":"_workflow_executor_result_rows_after_execution","id":11},{"text":"Workflow Executor - Result file names after execution","hash":"_workflow_executor_result_file_names_after_execution","id":12},{"text":"Workflow Executor - Main output of the transform","hash":"_workflow_executor_main_output_of_the_transform","id":13},{"text":"Repeat and End Repeat actions","hash":"_repeat_and_end_repeat_actions","id":14},{"text":"Wrapping up","hash":"_wrapping_up","id":15}]},"55":{"id":55,"text":"From the Apache Airflow website: Airflow is a platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. Airflow uses Directed Acyclic Graphs (or DAGs). A DAG is a collection of all the tasks you want to run, organized in a way that reflects their relationships and dependencies. A DAG is defined in a Python script, which represents the DAGs structure (tasks and their dependencies) as code. From an Apache Hop point of view, our focus is different: Apache Hop wants to enable citizen developers to be productive data engineers without the need to write code. With that in mind, we don’t need all the bells and whistles Apache Airflow provides (but don’t let that stop you from using Apache Airflow to its full potential!). The goal of this page is to get a basic Airflow setup running to demonstrate how Apache Airflow and Apache Hop can be used together. Check out the different installation options if you want to build a production-ready Apache Airflow installation. To keep things simple, we’ll use Docker Compose to get Apache Airflow up and running in a matter of minutes. Even though Docker Compose has been said to be on the verge of extinction for quite a while now, it still is a quick and convenient way to experiment with data platforms that would otherwise be time-consuming and difficult to set up. Apache Airflow provides a docker-compose.yaml file. Our goal is to run Apache Hop workflows and pipelines in Apache Airflow, so we’re not interested in the Airflow sample DAGs that come with this docker-compose file. Change the AIRFLOW__CORE__LOAD_EXAMPLES variable to \"false\" in the default file, and add an additional line /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock in the volumes section. All of this has already been done if you use the the file in our github repository. To run Apache Airflow from this docker-compose file, go the directory where you saved this file and run docker compose up The various Apache Airflow need a couple of moments to start. Once you see a couple of lines like the ones below in the logs, we’re good to go. apache-airflow-airflow-triggerer-1 | [2024-05-07 07:50:08 +0000] [24] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 24 apache-airflow-airflow-triggerer-1 | [2024-05-07 07:50:08 +0000] [25] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 25 apache-airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 | ____________ _____________ apache-airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 | ____ |__( )_________ __/__ /________ __ apache-airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 | ____ /| |_ /__ ___/_ /_ __ /_ __ \\_ | /| / / apache-airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 | ___ ___ | / _ / _ __/ _ / / /_/ /_ |/ |/ / apache-airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 | _/_/ |_/_/ /_/ /_/ /_/ \\____/____/|__/ apache-airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 | [2024-05-07T07:50:08.601+0000] {executor_loader.py:114} INFO - Loaded executor: CeleryExecutor apache-airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 | [2024-05-07T07:50:08.652+0000] {scheduler_job_runner.py:823} INFO - Starting the scheduler apache-airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 | [2024-05-07T07:50:08.653+0000] {scheduler_job_runner.py:830} INFO - Processing each file at most -1 times apache-airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 | [2024-05-07T07:50:08.657+0000] {manager.py:165} INFO - Launched DagFileProcessorManager with pid: 34 apache-airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 | [2024-05-07T07:50:08.658+0000] {scheduler_job_runner.py:1576} INFO - Resetting orphaned tasks for active dag runs apache-airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 | [2024-05-07T07:50:08.660+0000] {settings.py:60} INFO - Configured default timezone Timezone('UTC') Go to http://localhost:8080/home in your browser and log on with username \"airflow\" and password \"airflow\". Even though we’re not running in production, the username and password can be easily changed from the docker-compose file. Just change the values for the AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_USERNAME and AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD variables in the docker-compose file or use any of the available ways to work with variables in Docker compose. After you logged on, Apache Airflow will show you an empty list of DAGs. We’re ready for the real fun. We’ll use the Apache Airflow DockerOperator to run Apache Hop workflows and pipelines from an embedded container in Apache Airflow. Again, you don’t need to be an Apache Airflow, Docker, or Python expert to create DAGs, we’ll treat DAGs as just another text file. Since we’ll use a container to run our workflows and pipelines, the configuration in our DAG will look very similar to the environment variables you’ll pass to the short-lived Apache Hop container. Let’s take a closer look at a couple of things in the DAG we’ll use. This will look very familiar if you’ve even run Apache Hop workflows and pipelines in containers: Import the DockerOperator into your DAG: from airflow.operators.docker_operator import DockerOperator Let’s take a look at the end of the Apache Hop task first: mounts=[Mount(source='LOCAL_PATH_TO_PROJECT_FOLDER', target='/project', type='bind'), Mount(source='LOCAL_PATH_TO_ENV_FOLDER', target='/project-config', type='bind')], The mounts section is where we’ll link your project and environment folders to the container. LOCAL_PATH_TO_PROJECT_FOLDER is the path to the project folder on your local file system (the folder where you keep your hop-config.json file, metadata folder and workflows and pipelines). This folder will be mounted as /project inside the container. LOCAL_PATH_TO_ENV_FOLDER is similar but points to the folder where your environment configuration (json) files are. This folder will be mounted as /project-config inside the container. Define and configure the pipeline in your DAG task: hop = DockerOperator( task_id='sample-pipeline', # use the Apache Hop Docker image. Add your tags here in the default apache/hop: syntax image='apache/hop', api_version='auto', auto_remove=True, environment= { 'HOP_RUN_PARAMETERS': 'INPUT_DIR=', 'HOP_LOG_LEVEL': 'Basic', 'HOP_FILE_PATH': '${PROJECT_HOME}/transforms/null-if-basic.hpl', 'HOP_PROJECT_DIRECTORY': '/project', 'HOP_PROJECT_NAME': 'hop-airflow-sample', 'HOP_ENVIRONMENT_NAME': 'env-hop-airflow-sample.json', 'HOP_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG_FILE_NAME_PATHS': '/project-config/env-hop-airflow-sample.json', 'HOP_RUN_CONFIG': 'local' }, The parameters to specify here are: task_id: a unique id for this Airflow task in the DAG image: we use \"apache/hop\" in this example, which will always grab the latest release. Add a tag to use a specific Apache Hop release, e.g. \"apache/hop:2.4.0\" or \"apache/hop:Development\" for the very latest development version environment is where we’ll tell the DockerOperator which pipeline to run and provide additional configuration. The environment variables used here are exactly what you would pass to a standalone short-lived container without Airflow: HOP_RUN_PARAMETERS: parameters to pass to the workflow or pipeline HOP_LOG_LEVEL: the logging level to use with your workflow or pipeline HOP_FILE_PATH: the path to the workflow or pipeline you want to use. This is the path in the container and is relative to the project folder HOP_PROJECT_DIRECTORY: the folder where your project files live. In this example, this is the /project folder we mounted in the previous section. HOP_PROJECT_NAME: your Apache Hop project’s name. This will only be used internally (and will show in the logs). Your project name is not necessarily the same name you used to develop the project in Hop Gui, but keeping things consistent never hurts. HOP_ENVIRONMENT_NAME: similar to the project name, this is the name for the environment that will be created through hop-conf when the container starts. HOP_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG_FILE_NAME_PATHS: the paths to your environment configuration files. These file paths should be relative to the /project-config folder we mounted in the previous section. HOP_RUN_CONFIG: the workflow or pipeline run configuration to use. Your mileage may vary, but in the vast majority of cases, using a local run configuration will be what you need. That’s everything we need to specify for a first run. This DAG will look like the one below: from datetime import datetime, timedelta from airflow import DAG from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator from airflow.operators.docker_operator import DockerOperator from airflow.operators.python_operator import BranchPythonOperator from airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator from docker.types import Mount default_args = { 'owner' : 'airflow', 'description' : 'sample-pipeline', 'depend_on_past' : False, 'start_date' : datetime(2022, 1, 1), 'email_on_failure' : False, 'email_on_retry' : False, 'retries' : 1, 'retry_delay' : timedelta(minutes=5) } with DAG('sample-pipeline', default_args=default_args, schedule_interval=None, catchup=False, is_paused_upon_creation=False) as dag: start_dag = DummyOperator( task_id='start_dag' ) end_dag = DummyOperator( task_id='end_dag' ) hop = DockerOperator( task_id='sample-pipeline', # use the Apache Hop Docker image. Add your tags here in the default apache/hop: syntax image='apache/hop', api_version='auto', auto_remove=True, environment= { 'HOP_RUN_PARAMETERS': 'INPUT_DIR=', 'HOP_LOG_LEVEL': 'Basic', 'HOP_FILE_PATH': '${PROJECT_HOME}/transforms/null-if-basic.hpl', 'HOP_PROJECT_DIRECTORY': '/project', 'HOP_PROJECT_NAME': 'hop-airflow-sample', 'HOP_ENVIRONMENT_NAME': 'env-hop-airflow-sample.json', 'HOP_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG_FILE_NAME_PATHS': '/project-config/env-hop-airflow-sample.json', 'HOP_RUN_CONFIG': 'local' }, docker_url=\"unix://var/run/docker.sock\", network_mode=\"bridge\", mounts=[Mount(source='LOCAL_PATH_TO_PROJECT_FOLDER', target='/project', type='bind'), Mount(source='LOCAL_PATH_TO_ENV_FOLDER', target='/project-config', type='bind')], force_pull=False ) start_dag >> hop >> end_dag All it takes to deploy your dag is to put it in Airflow’s dags folder. Our docker-compose setup has created a dags folder in the directory where you started the compose file. Airflow will scan this folder every two minutes by default. Save the DAG we just created in your dags folder as apache-hop-dag-simple.py. After a short wait, your DAG will show up in the list of dags. If there are any syntax errors in your DAG, Airflow will let you know. Expand the error dialog for more details about the error, as shown in the image below. Don’t worry, you shouldn’t have any errors with the DAG we just created. If you’re using DockerOperator and need to access a database or service running on your host machine, be sure to set the host as host.docker.internal in the Hop connection configuration to allow the container to access the host services. If your DAG is deployed correctly (it should), you’ll see it show up in the list of available DAGs. Click on the sample-pipeline DAG to see more details about it. From the tab list at the top of the page, select \"Code\" to review the DAG you just deployed, or \"Graph\" to see the graph representation of the DAG. This graph is extremely simple, but we’re exploring Apache Airflow, so that’s intentional. To run this DAG, click the play icon with the Trigger DAG option. The icon is available from multiple locations in the Apache Airflow user interface. It is almost always available in the upper right corner. Your DAG will run in the background. To follow up and check the logs, click on your DAG name to go to its details page. 2024-05-07, 13:54:39 UTC] {docker.py:391} INFO - 2023/05/07 13:54:39 - Ouput.0 - Finished processing (I=0, O=0, R=5, W=5, U=0, E=0) [2024-05-07, 13:54:39 UTC] {docker.py:391} INFO - 2023/05/07 13:54:39 - null-if-basic - Pipeline duration : 0.45 seconds [ 0.450 ] [2024-05-07, 13:54:39 UTC] {docker.py:391} INFO - HopRun exit.

Your real-life pipelines will be more complex than the extremely simple example pipeline we just ran. In the basic example we just ran, we passed an environment file but didn’t use it. In a lot of cases, you’ll want to not only use variables from your environment files, you may also want to pass parameters to your pipelines and workflows. Let’s have a closer look at that. Create the environment configuration below to a config folder next to your project folder. We’ll use the pipeline pipelines/pipeline-with-parameter.hpl from the samples project to print a pipeline parameter and a variable from the environment configuration file to the logs. Again, these examples are extremely simple, your real-life projects will be more complex, but the process remains the same. { \"variables\" : [ { \"name\" : \"ENV_VARIABLE\", \"value\" : \"variable value\", \"description\" : \"\" } ] } This pipeline is again very basic. All we’ll do is accept a parameter and print it in the logs: We’ll create a new DAG for this example. Most of it will be the same or similar to the previous example, with some minor changes: First of all, we’ll need to add one additional import at the start of the DAG: from airflow import DAG from airflow.models import Variable from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator Next, we’ll need to add the parameter in this pipeline and tell Airflow to pick up the values from the run configuration we’ll pass to the DAG later on. We’ll also use logging level Detailed to make sure we can see the parameters we’ll pass to the pipeline. environment= { 'HOP_RUN_PARAMETERS': 'PRM_EXAMPLE=', 'HOP_LOG_LEVEL': 'Detailed', 'HOP_FILE_PATH': '${PROJECT_HOME}/hop/pipeline-with-parameter.hpl', 'HOP_PROJECT_DIRECTORY': '/project', 'HOP_PROJECT_NAME': 'hop-airflow-sample', 'HOP_ENVIRONMENT_NAME': 'env-hop-airflow-sample.json', 'HOP_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG_FILE_NAME_PATHS': '/project-config/hop-airflow-config.json', 'HOP_RUN_CONFIG': 'local' }, Also, we really need the environment configuration file this time, so make sure your mounts are correct. mounts=[Mount(source='/', target='/project', type='bind'), Mount(source='/config/', target='/project-config', type='bind')], Add this new DAG to your dags folder and wait for it to appear in your Apache Airflow console. To run this DAG with parameters, we’ll use the Trigger DAG w/ config option. We’ll specify the prm_example value that Airflow will pass to the PRM_EXAMPLE parameter in the pipeline. The syntax to use is shown below. Click \"Trigger\" when you’re done. Your DAG logs will now show the environment variable and the parameter we used in this example: [2024-05-08, 08:21:34 UTC] {docker.py:391} INFO - 2023/05/08 08:21:34 - pipeline-with-parameter - Pipeline has allocated 5 threads and 4 rowsets.

There are lots of well-documented options to schedule DAGs in Apache Airflow. Since scheduling your DAGs is not really Apache Hop related, we’ll only cover this briefly here. One option is to provide a cron string to schedule your DAG execution. For example, to run a specific DAG at 10:00 am every morning, we’ll change the schedule_interval from None to a cron expression in the \"with DAG\" line in our DAG (line breaks added for readability): with DAG( 'sample-pipeline', default_args=default_args, schedule_interval='0 10 * * *', catchup=False, is_paused_upon_creation=False ) as dag: For a more detailed description of the scheduling options in Apache Airflow, you may find this Medium post helpful. We’ve covered the basics of running Apache Hop pipelines (or workflows) in Apache Airflow with the DockerOperator. There are other options: you could use Airflow’s BashOperator to use hop-run directly or the HTTP operator to run pipelines or workflows on a remote hop server.","title":"Run workflows and pipelines in Apache Airflow","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"run-hop-in-apache-airflow","url":"/manual/latest/how-to-guides/run-hop-in-apache-airflow.html","titles":[{"text":"What is Apache Airflow?","hash":"_what_is_apache_airflow","id":1},{"text":"Run Apache Airflow in Docker Compose","hash":"_run_apache_airflow_in_docker_compose","id":2},{"text":"Your first Apache Airflow and Apache Hop DAG","hash":"_your_first_apache_airflow_and_apache_hop_dag","id":3},{"text":"Deploy and run your first DAG","hash":"_deploy_and_run_your_first_dag","id":4},{"text":"Using variables and parameters in a DAG","hash":"_using_variables_and_parameters_in_a_dag","id":5},{"text":"Scheduling a DAG in Apache Airflow","hash":"_scheduling_a_dag_in_apache_airflow","id":6},{"text":"Summary","hash":"_summary","id":7}]},"56":{"id":56,"text":"One of the first concepts new Apache Hop users learn is that pipelines are executed in parallel and workflows are executed sequentially. However, there are cases where you want to overrule these defaults and execute pipelines sequentially and workflows in parallel. We’ll take a closer look at the latter use case in more detail and show how you can run actions in a workflow in parallel. As you already know, actions in a workflow are executed sequentially. Each action in a workflow has an exit code (success or failure) that determines the path the workflow will follow. This exit code can be ignored in the case of an unconditional hop. A workflow action can have multiple outgoing hops. However, this doesn’t mean the workflow will follow all hops in parallel. If an action has multiple outgoing hops, the default workflow behavior is to execute all actions sequentially in the order they were added to the workflow. In the example below, the workflow will execute \"sample-pipeline.hpl 1\" first. Once that action is completed, the workflow will continue to \"sample-pipeline.hpl 2\". Parallel execution in a workflow is possible, but this needs to be specified explicitly. To do so, click on an action’s icon and click the \"parallel execution\" option. Once the parallel option has been activated, the hop line will be dotted and double-crossed, as shown in the screenshot below. Keep in mind that parallel execution means that all actions that run in parallel will have to share the resources in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Small pipelines and workflow actions that run in parallel may be faster, but larger items that require a lot of memory or CPU power may be faster when executed sequentially. When you run this workflow, the log message will tell you both actions have started in parallel: 2023/05/01 10:14:42 - parallel-workflow - Start of workflow execution 2023/05/01 10:14:42 - parallel-workflow - Starting action [sample-pipeline.hpl 1] 2023/05/01 10:14:42 - parallel-workflow - Launched action [sample-pipeline.hpl 1] in parallel. 2023/05/01 10:14:42 - parallel-workflow - Starting action [sample-pipeline.hpl 2] 2023/05/01 10:14:42 - parallel-workflow - Launched action [sample-pipeline.hpl 2] in parallel. Once you tell a workflow to run in parallel from a given action, it will continue to run the subsequent actions in parallel. Consider the extremely simple workflow below. This workflow starts both \"sample pipeline actions in parallel. After the sample pipelines, the workflow will execute the respective \"Write to log\" actions, and both workflows will execute the \"Dummy\" action. The effective result will be what is shown in the second screenshot below: In a lot of cases, you’ll only want to execute parts of a workflow in parallel. Example use cases could be that you want to load data to a number of relatively small database tables or generate a number of relatively small files before continuing with the more heavy lifting. In those scenarios, you’ll want to isolate the parallel processing in a separate child workflow. In the screenshot below, we’ve isolated the part of the workflow we want to execute in parallel into a child workflow. When this workflow runs, the child workflow (\"parallel workflow\") will run both actions in parallel. The child workflow will run both sample pipelines in parallel. When the last of these two pipelines finishes, the parent workflow will continue its (sequential) execution. In this post, we walked through the various options to run workflow actions in parallel in Apache Hop. You also learned how to combine parallel and sequential execution through child workflows.","title":"Parallel execution in Apache Hop workflows","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"workflows-parallel-execution","url":"/manual/latest/how-to-guides/workflows-parallel-execution.html","titles":[{"text":"Multiple workflow action hops","hash":"_multiple_workflow_action_hops","id":1},{"text":"Parallel execution","hash":"_parallel_execution","id":2},{"text":"Combining sequential and parallel execution","hash":"_combining_sequential_and_parallel_execution","id":3},{"text":"Summary","hash":"_summary","id":4}]},"57":{"id":57,"text":"Every workflow or pipeline you execute through Hop Gui or Hop Run and a lot of the other tools generate logging as logging text in the most obvious form.

Metadata is typically stored as json files in a projects' metadata folder as a set of json files, in subfolders per metadata type. The only exception to the rule are workflows and pipelines, which are defined as XML (for now, because of historical reasons). Since workflows and pipelines are what Hop is all about, these are typically stored in your project folder, not in your project’s metadata folder.

Pipelines perform the heavy lifting: they read data from a variety of sources, perform a number of operations (combine, clean, enrich, transform etc) and write the data out to some target platform. A pipeline executes all of these operations in a predefined order and in parallel. In the image below, a very simple pipeline reads data from a database, adds a message to the data and sends out an email. All of these operations are executed in a predefined order (read from the database, add the message, send the mail) and in parallel. The pipelines executes these transforms, Imagine our database table or query contains thousands of rows. The pipeline will start reading results from the query, pass those on to the 'Add message' transform. Once the message has been added, we’ll send a mail from the Mail transform. All of these will operate in parallel, so the Mail transform will already be sending mails while the table input is still reading records from the table or query. Pipelines consist of transforms connected by hops. In the mail example 'Table input', 'Add message' and 'Mail' are all transforms. transforms are the basic operations in your pipeline. A pipeline typically consists of a lot of transforms that are chained together by hops. Transforms are granular, in the sense that each transform is designed and optimized to perform one and only one task. Although one transform by itself may not offer spectacular functionality, the combination of all transforms in a pipeline is makes your pipelines powerful. hops link transforms together. When a transform finishes processing the data set it received, that data set is passed to the next transform through a hop. Hops are uni-directional (data can’t flow backwards). Hops only buffer and pass data around, the hop itself is transform-agnostic, it doesn’t know anything about the transforms it passes data from or to. Some transforms can read from or write to other transforms conditionally to or from a number of other transforms, but this a transform-specific configuration. The hop is unaware of it. Hops can be disabled by clicking on them, or through right-click → disable. Create a new pipeline through the work item dialog. You’ll be presented with the dialog shown below.

When you develop a pipeline, the transforms with all of the configuration options, the hops between those transforms and the pipeline run configuration you use to run the pipeline are all metadata items. There are use cases where you’ll find yourself creating different variations of what is basically the same pipeline. Consider this simple pipeline as an example: you need to load transaction data values from a supplier, filter out some specific values, and output everything to a file. The process is always the same, the only difference is the different file layouts, maybe different values to filter out, and the output file. Metadata injection can make this process a lot easier by taking the metadata for this pipeline from various sources and inject it into a template pipeline at runtime. After injection, Apache Hop has an in-memory pipeline that is configured for the exact metadata you need for this run. Instead of one pipeline per supplier, you’ll only need one template pipeline and one injecting pipeline. This significantly reduces the number of files to maintain, the number of repetitive tasks and thus increases stability maintainability of your project. the sample below is available from the metadata-injection folder in the samples project. The template pipeline is an empty pipeline that contains all the necessary transforms and hops for the flow of the pipeline, but none of the configuration. The injecting pipeline is a standard pipeline that gathers and prepares all of the required metadata to run the template pipeline through the ETL Metadata Injection transform. The Metadata Injection transform reads the template pipeline and lets you map fields from the injecting pipeline to target fields in the transforms in the template pipelines. Here’s what happens in the example below: read customer metadata parses a sample file and reads its file layout. The various items of the detected file layout are injected in the fields for read customer data in the template pipeline. static filename, format provides the file name and file format from a data grid. rename fields provides the original names and new names for fields that will be injected into the cast dates Select Values transform in the template pipeline. zips per state provides all of the required information to configure nb zip codes per state the Memory Group By transform in the template pipeline In addition to the injection explained above, the sort state Sort Rows transform etc are configured by information (metadata) that was already provided to the metadata injection transform. Additionally, the metadata injection can be configured to provide static (hard-coded) values to the template pipeline. The ETL Metadata Injection transform overrules the default behavior for pipelines: not all incoming streams need to have the same layout. It is perfectly ok to provide input to the metadata injection transform from different streams with different layouts. The ETL Metadata Injection transform generates and executes a generated pipeline with the injected metadata by default. This may be one too many levels of abstraction when you’re debugging or troubleshooting pipelines that use metadata injection. This default behavior can be overruled from the Options tab: Optional target file (hpl after injection) Run resulting pipeline Disabling the run resulting pipeline and providing a filename for the injected pipelines to be written to lets you open and troubleshoot the generated pipelines as you would with any other pipeline. This can make troubelshooting metadata injection significantly more productive. We recommend the following basic procedure for using this transform to inject metadata: Optimize your data for injection, such as preparing folder structures and inputs. Develop pipelines for the repetitive process (the template pipeline), for metadata injection through the ETL Metadata Injection transform, and for handling multiple inputs. The metadata is injected into the template pipeline through any transform that supports metadata injection.

or row, where these subsets form a partition of the original set with no item replicated into multiple groups. Partitioning data is an important feature to scale your Hop pipelines up and out. Scaling up makes the most of a single server with multiple CPU cores, while scaling out maximizes the resources of multiple servers operating in parallel. By default, each transform in a pipeline is executed in parallel in a single separate thread. Consider, for example, the pipeline below. With a single copy of each transform, the data is read from the CSV file input transform and then aggregated in the count by state transform. The results of which can be verified by examining the preview data. To take advantage of the processing resources in your run configuration, you can scale up the pipeline using the multi-threading option Change Number of Copies to Start to produce multiple copies of the transform (click the transform’s icon to open the context dialog and select 'Specify copies' in the 'Data routing' category). As shown below, the x2 notation indicates that two copies will be started at runtime. By default, this data movement from the CSV file input transform into the count by state transform will be performed in round-robin order. This means that if there are 'N' copies, the first copy gets the first row, the second copy gets the second row, and the Nth copy receives the Nth row. Row N+1 goes to the first copy again, and so on until there are no more rows to distribute. Reading the data from the CSV file is done in parallel. Attempting to aggregate in parallel, however, produces incorrect results because the rows are split arbitrarily (without a specific rule) over the two copies of the count by state aggregation transform, as shown in the preview data. Data distribution in the transforms is shown in the following table. As you can see, the CSV file input transform divides the work between two transform copies and each copy reads 5000 rows of data. However, these 2 transform copies also need to make sure that the rows end up on the correct count by state transform copy where they arrive in a 5004/4996 split. Because of that, it is a general rule that the transform performing the repartitioning (row redistribution) of the data (a non-partitioned transform before a partitioned one) has internal buffers from every source transform copy to every target transform copy, as shown below. This is where partitioning data becomes a useful concept, as it applies specific rule-based direction for aggregation, directing rows from the same state to the same transform copy, so that the rows are not split arbitrarily. In the example below, a partition schema called State was applied to the count by state transform and the Remainder of division partitioning rule was applied to the State field. Now, the count by state aggregation transform produces consistent correct results because the rows were split up according to the partition schema and rule, as shown in the preview data. The Table output transform supports partitioning rows of data to different tables. When configured to accept the table name from a Partitioning field, the PDI client will output the rows to the appropriate table. You can also Partition data per month or Partition data per day. To ensure that all the necessary tables exist, we recommend creating them in a separate pipeline. The partitioning method you use can be based on any criteria, can include no rule (round-robin row distribution), or can be created using a partitioning method plugin. The idea is to establish a criterion by which to partition the data, so that resulting storage and processing groups are logically independent from each other. Step One: setup the partition schema: First, configure a partition schema. A partition schema defines how many ways the row stream will be split. The names used for the partitions can be anything you like. Next, apply the partition schema to the Group By transform. By applying a partition schema to a transform, a matching set of transform copies is started automatically (for example, if applying a partition schema with three partitions, three transform copies are launched). Step Two: select the partitioning method: Establish the partitioning method for the transform, which defines the rule for row distribution across the copies. The Remainder of division rule allows rows with the same state value to be sent to the same transform copy and the distribution of similar rows among the transforms. If the modulo is calculated on a non-integer value, the Apache Hop client calculates the modulo on a checksum created from the String, Date, and Number value. When you run the pipeline, there are no guarantees as to which page name goes to which transform copy, only that any page name encountered is consistently forwarded to the same transform copy. When a partitioned transform passes data to another partitioned transform with the same partition schema, the data is kept in swimlanes because no repartitioning needs to be done. As illustrated below, no extra buffers (row sets) are allocated between the copies of transforms count by state and Replace in string. The transform copies remain isolated from one another and the rows of data travel in swimlanes. No extra work needs to be done to keep the data partitioned, so you can chain as many partitioned transforms as needed. This will internally be executed as shown in the following illustration. When you use partitioning, the logic used for distribution, repartitioning, and buffer allocations will be dependent upon the following rules: A partitioned transform causes one transform copy to be executed per partition in the partition schema. When a transform needs to repartition the data, the transform creates buffers (row sets) from each source transform copy to each target transform copy (partition). When rows of data pass from a non-partitioned transform to a partitioned one, data is repartitioned and extra buffers are allocated. When rows of data, partitioned with the same partition schema, pass from a partitioned transform to another partitioned transform, data is not repartitioned. When rows of data, partitioned with a different partition schema, pass from a partitioned transform to another partitioned transform, data is repartitioned.","title":"Partitioning","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"partitioning","url":"/manual/latest/pipeline/partitioning.html","titles":[{"text":"Data Partitioning During Processing","hash":"_data_partitioning_during_processing","id":1},{"text":"Understand repartitioning logic","hash":"_understand_repartitioning_logic","id":2},{"text":"Partitioning data over tables","hash":"_partitioning_data_over_tables","id":3},{"text":"Use partitioning","hash":"_use_partitioning","id":4},{"text":"Use data swimlanes","hash":"_use_data_swimlanes","id":5},{"text":"Rules for partitioning","hash":"_rules_for_partitioning","id":6}]},"84":{"id":84,"text":"Hop pipelines manipulate data coming from a variety of data sources, reading input and producing output.

Hop unit tests can speed up development in a number of cases: pipelines without design time input: mappings, single threader, …​ when input data doesn’t exist yet, is in development, or where there is no direct access to the source system. When it takes a long time to get to input data, long running queries, …​ Please note that you can flag a unit test to be opened and selected automatically when a pipeline is loaded in Hop Gui. Hop uses the following concepts (metadata objects) to work with pipeline unit tests: Data set : A set of rows with a certain layout, stored in a CSV data set. When used as input we call it an input data set. When used to validate a transform’s output we call it a golden data set. Unit test tweak: the ability to remove or bypass a transform during a test Unit test: The combination of input data sets, golden data sets, tweaks and a pipeline. You can have 0, 1 or more input or golden data sets defined in a unit test. You can have multiple unit tests defined per pipeline. a default data set folder can be specified in the project dialog. Check the 'Data Sets CSV Folder (HOP_DATASETS_FOLDER)'. By default, the value for the ${HOP_DATASETS_FOLDER} variable is set to ${PROJECT_HOME}/datasets. When a pipeline is executed in Hop Gui and a unit test is selected the following happens: all transforms marked with an input data set are replaced with an Injector transform all transforms marked with a golden data set are replaced with a dummy transform (does nothing). all transforms marked with a \"Bypass\" tweak are replaced with a dummy. all transforms marked with a \"Remove\" tweak are removed These operations take place on a copy of the pipeline, in memory only unless you specify a hpl file location in the unit test dialog. After execution, transform output is validated against golden data and logged. In case of errors in the test, a dialog will pop up when running in Hop Gui. The 'Unit Testing' category in the transform context dialog (click on transform icon to open) contains the available unit testing options: Set input data set: For the active unit test, it defines which data set to use instead of the output of the transform Clear input data set: Remove a defined input data set from this transform unit test Set golden data set: The input to this transform is taken and compared to the golden data set you are selecting. Clear golden data set: Remove a defined input data set for this transform unit test Create data set: Create an empty data set with the output fields of this transform Write rows to data set: Run the current pipeline and write the data to a data set Remove from test: When this unit test is run, do not include this transform Include in test: Run the current pipeline and write the data to a data set Bypass in test: When this unit test is run, bypass this transform (replace with a dummy) Remove bypass in test: Do not bypass this transform in the current pipeline during testing creating data sets is also possible from the 'New' context menu or metadata perspective. Consider the following basic pipeline below. This pipeline reads data from a csv file, extracts the years from a date of birth, counts rows by this year, sorts and writes out to a file. We’ll use this example to create a test to verify the output of the pipeline is what we expected. Click the '+' icon (highlighted) in the unit testing toolbar to create a new unit test. Previously created unit tests will be available from the dropdown box for editing. The options in this dialog are: Name name to use for this unit test Description a description for this unit test Type of test 'Unit test' or 'Development' The pipeline to test the pipeline this test applies to. By default, you should see the active pipeline filename here. Test pipeline filename (Optional) the filename to use for this unit test. Base test path (or use HOP_UNIT_TESTS_FOLDER) the folder to store this unit test to. Select this test automatically default: false Replace a database connection with another specify a list of database connections for this pipeline that you’d like to swap out for a test-specific connection. Variables a list of variables to use in testing. You’ll get a popup dialog Do you want to use this unit test for the active pipeline '?'. Since we’re creating a unit test for the active pipeline in this example, confirming is fine. Click on the 'read customers' transform icon to open the context dialog, click 'Create data set'. The popup dialog already shows the field layout in the bottom half of the dialog. Give the data set a name and file name. Do the same for the output transform you’ll want to check the data for ('customers by year out' in the example). check the metadata perspective. You should now have two data sets available. To write data to the newly created data sets, click the 'read customers' transform icon again, click 'Write rows to data set'. You’ll get a popup dialog asking you to select the data set, followed by a dialog where you can map transform output fields to data set fields. For this example, just click 'guess'. Repeat for the 'customer by year out' transform and data set. Click the 'read customers' transform icon again, select 'set input data set'. Select the data set and accept the sort order. Repeat for 'customers by year out', but use 'Set golden data set'. Your pipeline now has two new indicators for ths input and output data set. If the pipeline runs with all tests passed, you’ll receive a notification in the logs: 2021/04/21 21:16:43 - get year.0 - Finished processing (I=0, O=0, R=10000, W=10000, U=0, E=0) 2021/04/21 21:16:43 - count by year.0 - Finished processing (I=0, O=0, R=10000, W=22, U=0, E=0) 2021/04/21 21:16:43 - sort by year.0 - Finished processing (I=0, O=0, R=22, W=22, U=0, E=0) 2021/04/21 21:16:43 - customers by year out.0 - Finished processing (I=0, O=0, R=22, W=22, U=0, E=0) 2021/04/21 21:16:43 - read-customers - Unit test 'read-customers UNIT' passed succesfully 2021/04/21 21:16:43 - read-customers - ---------------------------------------------- 2021/04/21 21:16:43 - read-customers - customers by year out - customers-by-year : Test passed succesfully against golden data set 2021/04/21 21:16:43 - read-customers - Test passed succesfully against unit test 2021/04/21 21:16:43 - read-customers - ---------------------------------------------- 2021/04/21 21:16:43 - read-customers - Pipeline duration : 0.108 seconds [ 0.108 ] 2021/04/21 21:16:43 - read-customers - Execution finished on a local pipeline engine with run configuration 'local' If changes to the pipeline cause the test to fail, a popup will be shown for the failed rows. In the example below, the number of rows for the year 1990 was changed from 486 to 487, causing the test to fail: While successful test show 'Test passed succesfully against golden data set' and 'Test passed succesfully against unit test', failed unit tests may show one of the error messages listed below: Incorrect number of rows received from transform, golden data set has rows in it and we received Validation against golden data failed for row number , field : transform value [] does not correspond to data set value [] While developing pipelines, you’ll often remove or disable transforms in a pipeline. We can do the same in unit tests. In our example, we may want to remove or bypass the transform that caused the test to fail ('486 → 487'). Click on the transform icon and select either 'Bypass in Test' or 'Remove from test'. Bypassing a transform in a test will replace the transform with a Dummy transform while executing the test. As the name implies, 'Remove from test' will remove the transform from the test pipeline, exactly like you would remove a transform from a pipeline. In the case of bypassing a transform, your pipeline will look like the one below ('Remove' will add a similar icon to the transform icon, crossing it out). There is a workflow action called \"Run Pipeline Unit Tests\" which can execute all defined unit tests of a certain type. The output of the transform can be stored in any format or location with regular Hop transforms. Execute the workflow through hop-run, in a scheduler or through a CI/CD pipeline in e.g. Jenkins. Use the 'Get test names' in this action to specify which of the available unit tests you want to include in your workflow. In the workflow logging output, you’ll find information about the exit state of your unit tests: 2021/04/22 10:05:23 - read-customers - Unit test 'read-customers UNIT' passed succesfully 2021/04/22 10:05:23 - read-customers - ---------------------------------------------- 2021/04/22 10:05:23 - read-customers - customers by year out - customers-by-year : Test passed succesfully against golden data set 2021/04/22 10:05:23 - read-customers - Test passed succesfully against unit test 2021/04/22 10:05:23 - read-customers - ---------------------------------------------- 2021/04/22 10:05:23 - read-customers - Pipeline duration : 0.227 seconds [ 0.227\" ] Similar to the workflow action, there’s a transform to run your unit tests:","title":"Pipeline Unit Testing","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"pipeline-unit-testing","url":"/manual/latest/pipeline/pipeline-unit-testing.html","titles":[{"text":"The need for unit testing","hash":"_the_need_for_unit_testing","id":1},{"text":"Main components of a unit test","hash":"_main_components_of_a_unit_test","id":2},{"text":"Unit tests in runtime","hash":"_unit_tests_in_runtime","id":3},{"text":"Create unit tests","hash":"_create_unit_tests","id":4},{"text":"Unit test and data set options","hash":"_unit_test_and_data_set_options","id":5},{"text":"Create and add data sets","hash":"_create_and_add_data_sets","id":6},{"text":"Run the unit test","hash":"_run_the_unit_test","id":7},{"text":"Remove and bypass transforms in unit tests","hash":"_remove_and_bypass_transforms_in_unit_tests","id":8},{"text":"Automate unit test execution","hash":"_automate_unit_test_execution","id":9},{"text":"Run unit tests in a workflow","hash":"_run_unit_tests_in_a_workflow","id":10},{"text":"Run unit tests in a pipeline","hash":"_run_unit_tests_in_a_pipeline","id":11}]},"85":{"id":85,"text":"Pipelines, together with workflows, are the main building blocks in Hop. Pipelines perform the heavy data lifting: in a pipeline, you read data from one or more sources, perform a number of operations (joins, lookups, filters and lots more) and finally write the processed data to one or more target platforms. Pipelines are a network of transforms, connected by hops. Just like the actions in a workflow, each transform is a small piece of functionality. The combination of a number of transforms allow Hop developers to build powerful data processing and, in combination with workflows, orchestration solutions. Even though there is some visual resemblance, workflows and pipelines operate very differently. The core principles of pipelines are: pipelines are networks. Each transform in a pipeline is part of the network. a pipeline runs all of its transforms in parallel. All transforms are started and process data simultaneously. In a simple pipeline where you read data from a large file, do some processing and finally write to a database table, you’re typically still reading from the file while you’re already loading data to the database. data flows through the various transforms in a pipeline over hops. In contrast to workflow hops, pipeline hops typically don’t have an exit status. Pipelines do have some routing capabilities through e.g. Filter Rows transform and error handling, but the core pipeline principle still applies: the pipeline is a network, and data flow through the network in parallel. The example below shows a very basic pipeline. This is what happens when we run this pipeline: the pipeline has 7 transforms. All 7 of these transforms become active when we start the pipeline. the \"read-25M-records\" transform starts reading data from a file, and pushes that data down the stream to \"perform-calculations\" and the following transforms. Since reading 25 million records takes a while, some data may already have finished processing while we’re still reading records from the file. the \"lookup-sql-data\" matches data we read from the file with data we retrieved from the \"read-sql-data\" transform. The Stream Lookup accepts input from the \"read-sql-data\", which is shown with the information icon on the hop. once the data from the file and sql query are matched, we check a condition with the Filter Rows transform in \"condition?\". The output of this data is passed to \"write-to-table\" or \"write-to-file\", depending on whether the condition outcome was true or false. Pipelines are an extensive topic.

Having multiple copies of a transform results in multiple threads for this transform, and can improve a pipeline’s performance if used correctly. increasing the number of copies for your transforms is not a silver bullet or a performance=fast option. Excessive use of the specify copies option can easily make your pipelines performance worse instead of better. Click on a transform’s icon and click on the Specify copies icon in the pop-up dialog. Change the number of copies for the selected transform in the dialog that will pop up: Your transform will now show the number of copies you specified in the upper left corner of the transform’s icon. When your pipeline starts, Apache Hop will create the specified number of copies for this transform in the background. The pipeline in the example above will look like the image below when executed. Increasing the number of copies for a limited number of transforms in your pipelines can help to improve your pipeline’s performance, but the option should be used with great care. the number of threads your CPUs or cores can handle is finite. Increasing the number of copies (and thus threads) can easily exceed what your system can handle, resulting in the opposite effect of what you want to achieve. There are no hard rules, use common sense to decided when (not) to increase the number of copies for your transforms. A number of guidelines to decide if using multiple copies for your transforms makes sense: is there a performance problem? If your pipeline is fast enough, there’s no need for multiple copies on any of your transforms. Identify the slowest transforms in your pipeline. Transforms that are a bottleneck get a dotted border during execution in Hop Gui. Are these bottleneck transforms CPU bound? If the CPU is not the bottleneck, increasing the number of copies won’t help. Increasing the number of copies for e.g. relational databases transforms like Table output depends on the technology you use. Some databases can handle multiple threads (transactions). Check the documentation for the technology in your data architecture. Some of the following transforms can be CPU heavy and may perform better with multiple copies. Once again: there’s no need to increase the number of copies if there are no performance problems or if these transforms are not the bottleneck in your pipeline. Calculator Formula Javascript Script Sort rows User defined Java class User defined java expression As with any performance optimization exercises, make tiny changes and measure performance before and after applying any changes. A special word of caution: when using multiple copies on a Sort rows transform, you need to add a Sorted merge transform, like in the screenshot below. The multiple copies of your Sort rows transform will each sort a subset of your stream. The Sorted merge transform will merge the (sorted) outputs of each of the Sort rows copies into a fully sorted output stream.","title":"Specify Copies","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"specify-copies","url":"/manual/latest/pipeline/specify-copies.html","titles":[{"text":"Changing the number of copies for a transform","hash":"_changing_the_number_of_copies_for_a_transform","id":1},{"text":"Use cases","hash":"_use_cases","id":2}]},"88":{"id":88,"text":"Transforms are the cornerstone of HOP, they are used to process and transform your data, they are the building blocks that are used to create a pipeline.

For example, while one project matures and is in user acceptance testing, development work on a new project has already started. Different sets of workflows and pipelines require management for at least development, acceptance and production environments. Every project and each environment comes with its own set of variables and configurations for databases, file paths …​ Hop wants to make it easy for Hop developers to use one or more projects alongside each other. A project is the collection of all the files you need in your data orchestration solution. This typically includes metadata, pipelines, workflows, reference files, documentation and so on. To match standard development best practices you would check all these files into a version control system like git. project variables should only be used when you need variables on the project level. All variables to connect to infrastructure, e.g. database connection parameters, mail servers etc that take different values in different environments should be created at the environment level. Project configurations are stored in hop-config.json, which is read from hop/config by default. Use the HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER operating system variable to store your Hop configuration in a folder outside your Hop folder. This will let you keep your project list if you switch Hop installations or upgrade to a newer Hop version. Projects can inherit metadata and variables from a parent project. Projects in Hop Gui will remember opened files, zoom levels and other UI settings. What is typically not included in the set of project files are the metadata configurations and variable values required to make the project run correctly in a given environment. For example on a development laptop you might want to set a variable ${DB_HOSTNAME} to localhost, on a production server this value might point to the production database server. This is where Hop environments come in. Environment is short for Project Lifecycle Environment. It describes the phase of a project in its lifecycle moving from Development to Test to Acceptance to Production. It can also describe a project in a continuous integration environment and so on. As such the following attributes define an environment: Its name The name of the project The phase The configuration files you want to use to define the environment specific variables Just like projects, environments are defined in one or a number of configuration files. store your environment configuration files outside of the project folder.

Check full list of variables to check them all. A couple of useful and often overlooked environment variables can be set (outside of Hop): HOP_AUDIT_FOLDER Set this variable to a valid path on your machine to store Hop’s audit information. This information includes last opened files per project, zoom size and lots more. HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER Hop stores your configuration in the config folder by default. Set this environment variable to point to a folder outside of your Hop installation to keep your configuration, projects and environment list etc, no matter which Hop version or installation you use. copy the contents of an existing hop/conf folder to the path set in HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER to move the configuration from one of your Hop installations to your new central location. HOP_PLUGIN_BASE_FOLDERS Set this variable to point Hop to a comma separated list of folders where you want Hop to look for additional plugins. When using this variable it will also unset your default plugins folder, make sure to add the default plugin folder to the comma separated list. This can be a relative path to the installation eg. export HOP_PLUGIN_BASE_FOLDERS=./plugins,/additional/plugin/folder. The ./plugins will point to the plugins in the base installation folder HOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDERS This is a comma separated list of folder containing JDBC drivers, default value is lib/jdbc. If you still need the default jdbc drivers when changing this you need to include the default folder path. HOP_WINDOWS_SHELL_ENCODING This variable is for Windows users. It is possible that the shell encoding (the things you see in the CMD window) does not match your system encoding. This can cause confusion when using special characters in logging and Shell Action/transform. You can determine which codepage/encoding your system is using by executing following command in Powershell [System.Text.Encoding]::Default. You can then use the value shown at WindowsCodePage and set the HOP_WINDOWS_SHELL_ENCODING parameter to this value. To set Windows Variables go to System → System Properties → Environment Variables and define this on user or system scope CTRL-K In any table view in a Hop dialog, select one or more lines and use CTRL-K to remove all lines but your selection CTRL-SHIFT-Click Hover your mouse pointer over any pipeline action in a workflow, pipeline or workflow executor transform etc and use CTRL-SHIFT-Click to open that item in a new tab.

Delete this action Delete the action from the workflow Edit Custom Logging Edit the custom log settings for this workflow. This will change the log level used for this action. Clear Custom Logging Clear custom log settings. This will clear the log level used for this action. Parallel execution Execute the next actions in parallel. Notice how the hops in your workflow are a little different from what you’ve seen in pipeline hops. Add a fourth action 'Abort' and create a hop from your pipeline action. Notice how the hop between your pipeline and Abort is different from the one between pipeline and Success. The hop types used in workflows are listed below. Hop Icon Description Unconditional hop Lock icon, black hop Unconditional hops are followed no matter what the exit code (true/false) of the previous action is Success hop Check icon, green hop Success hops are used when the previous action executed successfully. Failure hop Error icon, red hop Failure hops are followed when the previous action failed. The hop type can be changed by clicking on the hop’s icon. Workflow properties are a collection of properties that describe the workflow and configure its behavior. The properties dialog can be opened by double clicking on the workflow canvas. Following properties can be configured: Workflow Parameters Settings The Workflow tab allows you to specify general properties about the workflow including: Property Description Workflow name The name of the workflow Synchronize name with filename If option is enabled the filename and workflow name are synchronized. Workflow filename The filename of the workflow Description Short description of the workflow Extended description Long extended description of the workflow Status Draft or production status Version Description of the version Created by Displays the original creator of the workflow Created at Displays the date and time when the workflow was created. Last modified by Displays the last user that modified the workflow Last modified at Displays the date and time when the workflow was last modified. The parameters tab allows you to specify parameters specific for the workflow. Parameters are defined by a name, a default value and a description. The settings tab allows you to pass the batch ID.","title":"Create a Workflow","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"create-workflow","url":"/manual/latest/workflow/create-workflow.html","titles":[{"text":"Concepts","hash":"_concepts","id":1},{"text":"Creation","hash":"_creation","id":2},{"text":"Add Action to your workflow","hash":"_add_action_to_your_workflow","id":3},{"text":"Workflow properties","hash":"_workflow_properties","id":4}]},"106":{"id":106,"text":"As with designing workflows, the steps to run a workflow are very similar to running a pipeline.

Where pipelines do the heavy data lifting, workflows take care of the orchestration work: prepare the environment, fetch remote files, perform error handling and executing child workflows and pipelines. Workflows consist of a series of actions, connected by hops. Just like a transform in a pipeline, each action is a small piece of functionality. The combination of a number of actions allows Hop developers to build powerful data orchestration solutions. Even though there is some visual resemblance, workflows and pipelines operate very differently. Workflows perform orchestration tasks. Actions in a workflow usually do not operate on the data directly (even though you can change data e.g. through SQL). Workflows have one (and only one) mandatory starting point (a Start action), but can have multiple end actions. Workflows can Workflows work sequentially by default. Each action in a workflow has a position in the workflow sequence, and needs to wait before the previous actions have completed before it starts. Workflow actions do not pass data over hops. Each workflow action has a success or failure exit status. This exit status is used to choose the routing through the workflow. Hops between actions in a workflow have a status: depending on the exit status of the previous action, a workflow hop can follow the success (green), failure (orange) or unconditional (black) hop. An unconditional hop ignores the exit status of the previous action and is followed whether the previous action failed or succeeded. Like all workflows, the example workflow shown below starts with the start action. The Start action is just a placeholder that can’t really fail, so the hop out of a start action is unconditional. The workflow then continues with a pipeline action, \"first-pipeline\". As the name implies, this action executes a pipeline. If \"first-pipeline\" runs successfully, the workflow continues to \"second-pipeline\". If \"first-pipeline\" fails, the failure hop to \"handle-errors\" is followed. In this hypothetical example, we don’t care about the result of \"Second pipeline\", and want to continue to \"delete-tmp-files\", where any temporary files are removed. If the temporary files are removed successfully, we move on to the \"success\" action. Similar to the Start action, success is a visual indicator of successful completion of this part of the workflow. It’s not mandatory and doesn’t add any functionality, but it often is a good visual indicator of an end point of your workflow’s main stream.

Let’s dive into a few fun information tidbits: By referencing the samples project Hop knows where the project is located (config/projects/samples) Since we know the location of the project, we can specify pipelines and workflows with a relative path The project knows where its metadata is stored (config/projects/samples/metadata) so it knows where to find the Direct pipeline run configuration (config/projects/samples/metadata/pipeline-run-configuration/Direct.json) This run configuration defines its own pipeline engine specific variables, in this case the output folder : DATA_OUTPUT=${PROJECT_HOME}/beam/output/ The output of the samples is as such written to config/projects/samples/beam/output To reference an environment you can execute using -e or --environment.

If this option is set too low, an additional network call will be incurred when acquiring a connection, which causes a performance hit. If this is set high, you may receive sessions that are backed by no longer live connections, which will lead to exceptions in your application. Assuming the database is running, these exceptions will go away if you retry acquiring sessions. Hence, this parameter tunes a balance between the likelihood of your application seeing connection problems, and performance. You normally should not need to tune this parameter. No connection liveliness check is done by default. Value 0 means connections will always be tested for validity and negative values mean connections will never be tested. Pooled connections older than this threshold will be closed and removed from the pool. Such discarding happens during connection acquisition so that new session is never backed by an old connection. Setting this option to a low value will cause a high connection churn and might result in a performance hit. It is recommended to set maximum lifetime to a slightly smaller value than the one configured in network equipment (load balancer, proxy, firewall, etc. can also limit maximum connection lifetime). Setting can also be used in combination with the Connection Liveness Check Timeout (ms) value. In this case, it is recommended to set liveness check to a value smaller than network equipment has and maximum lifetime to a reasonably large value to \"renew\" connections once in a while. Default maximum connection lifetime is 1 hour. Zero and negative values result in lifetime not being checked. Configure the maximum amount of connections in the connection pool towards a single database. This setting limits total amount of connections in the pool when used in direct driver, created for URI with 'bolt' scheme. It will limit amount of connections per cluster member when used with routing driver, created for URI with 'neo4j' scheme. Acquisition will be attempted for at most configured timeout Connection Acquisition Timeout(ms) when limit is reached. Default value is 100. Negative values are allowed and result in unlimited pool. Value of 0 is not allowed. Configure the maximum amount of time the connection acquisition will attempt to acquire a connection from the connection pool. This timeout only kicks in when all existing connections are being used and no new connections can be created because maximum connection pool size has been reached. An error is thrown when a connection can’t be acquired within the configured time. The default value is 60 seconds. Negative values are allowed and result in unlimited acquisition timeout. Value of 0 is allowed and results in no timeout and immediate failure when connection is unavailable. Specify the maximum time transactions are allowed to retry via session read and write transactions. These methods will retry the given unit of work on ServiceUnavailableException, SessionExpiredException and TransientException with an exponential backoff using initial delay of 1 second. Default value is 30 seconds. You can specify a list of manual connection URLs to allow you to work with any advanced, legacy, bleeding edge, …​ feature you can possibly want.

Head over to the Google Cloud Console and create a project. Next, make sure your project is selected and, go to \"APIs & Services\" and enable Google Cloud Storage API and Google Dataflow API. In the \"Credentials\" tab of the Google Dataflow API home screen, you’ll see the service account that was created after you enabled the API. You’ll need this service account later on. Next, we’ll need to create a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Go to the Google Cloud Storage page for your project and create a bucket. we created a bucket \"apache-beam-hop\" in the \"europe-west1 (Belgium)\" region. All other settings can be left to the defaults. Create two folders \"input\" and \"output\" in this bucket and upload the two .txt files from the \"beam/input\" folder in your Apache Hop samples project to the input folder. In the Google Cloud Storage screen, select your bucket, then \"Permissions\", make sure to switch to \"Fine grained access control\" and make sure the service account has access to your bucket. Finally, go to the IAM & Admin → Service Accounts page of your Google Cloud project and click on the service account that was created when you enabled the Dataflow API. In this page, go to the Keys tab, and create and download a JSON key. Next, we’ll need to make sure your system knows how to use this key. There are multiple options, the easiest way is to set an environment variable. I used the command below on my Linux system: export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/beam-hop-demo-.json Apache Hop comes with a number of Apache Beam pipelines in the samples project. Let’s run those in our newly created Google Cloud project. First of all, we’ll need to create a fat jar. This fat jar is a self-contained library that contains everything Apache Beam and Google Dataflow will need to run our pipelines. This jar file will be several hundreds of MB and will be uploaded to the Google Cloud Storage bucket we created earlier. Click the Hop icon in Hop Gui’s upper left corner and select \"Generate a Hop fat jar\". After you specified a directory and file name (we used /tmp/hop-fat.jar) to store the fat jar, Hop will need a couple of minutes to generate your fat jar. With the fat jar in place, open the samples project in Apache Hop Gui and switch to the metadata perspective. The samples project comes with a pre-configured DataFlow pipeline run configuration that we’ll change to use our newly created Google Cloud project. Edit the run configuration to use the settings for the project we just created: For the sake of simplicity, check the \"Use public IPs?\" option. Check the Google Cloud docs to learn more about configuring your project to run with private IP addresses. In the Dataflow pipeline run configuration’s variables tab, change the values DATA_INPUT, STATE_INPUT and DATA_OUTPUT variables to the bucket name you just created. Als change the filename customers-noheader-1M.txt to customers-noheader-1k.txt. INFO: As mentioned in the introduction, distributed engines like Google Dataflow only make sense when you need to process large amounts of data. Working with small files like the customers file we’re about to process doesn’t make any sense in a real-world scenario. Working with small amounts of data will always be a lot faster in the native local or remote pipeline run configuration. You now have everything in place to run your first pipeline in Google Dataflow. Go back to the data orchestration perspective and open beam/pipelines/switch-case.hpl from the samples project. The Beam File Input and Beam File output transforms at the start of the pipeline are special Beam transforms. Both point to Beam File Definitions that you can find in the metadata perspective. The only thing these transforms do is specify a file layout and a path (the $${DATA_DIR$} variable you changed earlier) where Dataflow can find the input files to read from and output files to write to. The rest of this pipeline is Just Another Pipeline. Hit the run button, choose the Dataflow run configuration and click \"Launch\". Apache Hop will upload your fat jar to the staging folder in your Google Cloud Storage bucket, which will take a couple of minutes (check the \"staging\" folder in your bucket). When that is done, a dataflow job will be created and started. Creating the job, starting the pods and running the pipeline will take another couple of minutes. The Dataflow job should finish successfully after a couple of minutes. Remember: distributed engines are not designed to handle small data files, the native (local or remote) pipeline run configurations will always perform better on small volumes of data. Notice how Dataflow created a job where the visual layout and the transform names are immediately recognizable from your Apache Hop pipeline. Check the logs at the bottom of the page. Now, switch back to Hop Gui and notice how your Switch Case pipeline has been updated with green success checks and transform metrics. The logging tab looks a little different than what you’re used to from pipelines that run in the native engine. Apache Hop depends on the logging information and metrics it receives from Apache Beam, which in its turn needs to receive logging and metrics from the called distributed platform (Dataflow in this case). 2023/06/03 15:44:18 - Hop - Pipeline opened. 2023/06/03 15:44:18 - Hop - Launching pipeline [switch-case]... 2023/06/03 15:44:18 - Hop - Started the pipeline execution. 2023/06/03 15:44:19 - General - Created Apache Beam pipeline with name 'switch-case' 2023/06/03 15:44:19 - General - Handled transform (INPUT) : Customers 2023/06/03 15:44:19 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : Switch / case, gets data from 1 previous transform(s), targets=4, infos=0 2023/06/03 15:44:19 - General - Transform NY reading from previous transform targeting this one using : Switch / case - TARGET - NY 2023/06/03 15:44:19 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : NY, gets data from 1 previous transform(s), targets=0, infos=0 2023/06/03 15:44:19 - General - Transform CA reading from previous transform targeting this one using : Switch / case - TARGET - CA 2023/06/03 15:44:19 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : CA, gets data from 1 previous transform(s), targets=0, infos=0 2023/06/03 15:44:19 - General - Transform Default reading from previous transform targeting this one using : Switch / case - TARGET - Default 2023/06/03 15:44:19 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : Default, gets data from 1 previous transform(s), targets=0, infos=0 2023/06/03 15:44:19 - General - Transform FL reading from previous transform targeting this one using : Switch / case - TARGET - FL 2023/06/03 15:44:19 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : FL, gets data from 1 previous transform(s), targets=0, infos=0 2023/06/03 15:44:19 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : Collect, gets data from 4 previous transform(s), targets=0, infos=0 2023/06/03 15:44:19 - General - Handled transform (OUTPUT) : switch-case, gets data from Collect 2023/06/03 15:44:19 - switch-case - Executing this pipeline using the Beam Pipeline Engine with run configuration 'DataFlow' 2023/06/03 15:47:25 - switch-case - Beam pipeline execution has finished.

Instead of focusing on efficient pipeline execution, the Direct Runner performs additional checks to ensure that users do not rely on semantics that are not guaranteed by the model. Using the Direct Runner for testing and development helps ensure that pipelines are robust across different Beam runners. In addition, debugging failed runs can be a non-trivial task when a pipeline executes on a remote cluster. Instead, it is often faster and simpler to perform local unit testing on your pipeline code. Unit testing your pipeline locally also allows you to use your preferred local debugging tools. check the Apache Beam Direct Runner docs for more details. The default settings for the direct runner should work by default, all you need to do is specify your fat jar location.

For example, for Hop 1.2, the latest currently supported version is 1.13. Make sure to download Flink for a recent and JDK 8 compatible Scale version. For Flink 1.3.6, this is Scala 2.11. Download your selected Flink version and unzip to a convenient location. To keep things as simple as possible, we’ll run a local single node Flink cluster with a single command.

Once Flink is available, you’ll be able to access your Flink Dashboard at http://localhost:8081/ In Hop Gui’s metadata perspective for the Samples project, edit the Flink pipeline run configuration and make sure the Fat jar file location (the very last option) points to the Hop fat jar you created earlier in the prerequisites. Running Hop pipelines on embedded Flink through Hop Gui will work just fine but is intended for testing purposes and won’t show in your Flink dashboard. You can leave the default Flink master to [local] to run the embedded Flink engine from Hop Gui. Set your Flink master to your cluster’s master. For embedded Flink, [local] will do. Go back to the data orchestration perspective and run one of the Beam pipelines in the samples project. In this example, we used samples/beam/pipelines/generate-synthetic-data.hpl When you start your pipeline from Hop Gui, it will appear in your Flink Dashboard. In a real-world setup, you’ll run your Flink pipelines from the Flink master through flink run. Set your Flink master to [auto] and export your Hop metadata again (see prerequisites). Unlike Spark you can not pass java options at runtime to the TaskManager. So we also want to set the PROJECT_HOME variable in the run configuration.

These are the files we need to make use of the Flink Kubernetes Operator in the example below: A Hop fat jar : generate once for the version of Hop you want to use (use the Hop GUI Tools menu or use hop-conf.sh -fj. Hop metadata export: a JSON file containing the metadata of your project (use the Hop GUI Tools menu or use hop-conf.sh -xm A Hop pipeline: A .hpl file (XML) which contains the pipeline metadata Note: Hop is capable of reading/writing files directly to s3:// buckets (or gs:// or azure://). The Flink operator wants to make it easy for you to start a new deployment of a Flink cluster on Kubernetes. To install it on your own K8s setup you can follow the Quick Start guide. We’ll be running our setup on Amazon Web Services' Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Our Apache Hop fat jar as well as our pipeline and metadata JSON file are all stored in a folder on S3. The goal in our setup is to generate sample data with an unbound (never ending) pipeline and then to send that data to a Kinesis stream: In the Flink deployment file below we’ll do the following things different from a standard setup: Run with Java 11 since we’re using Apache Hop >= 2.0.0 Run with Java 17 since we’re using Apache Hop >= 2.10.0 Create an ephemeral volume called hop-resources which is mounted by all images in folder /hop Before any Flink container starts we run an initContainer to copy our Hop files (fat jar, pipeline, metadata) to the hop-resources volume. Container agiledigital/s3-artifact-fetcher is used to synchronize an S3 folder with our ephemeral volume shared by the nodes/containers. We specify the Hop main Beam class and pass in the pipeline and metadata JSON filenames (now found locally on the container) along with the name of the Flink Hop pipeline run configuration as arguments. Consider the following file called flink-deployment.yml: apiVersion: flink.apache.org/v1beta1 kind: FlinkDeployment metadata: namespace: default name: hop-flink spec: image: flink:1.15-java11 flinkVersion: v1_15 flinkConfiguration: taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots: \"8\" taskmanager.memory.jvm-metaspace.size: \"512m\" serviceAccount: flink podTemplate: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: flink-pod-template spec: serviceAccount: flink containers: # # Make an ephemeral volume available to the main flink container # - name: flink-main-container volumeMounts: - mountPath: /hop name: hop-resources initContainers: # # Copy a folder from s3:// to an ephemeral volume # Put a Hop fat jar in it as well as Hop metadata (JSON) # and the pipeline to run. # - name: fetcher image: agiledigital/s3-artifact-fetcher env: - name: SOURCE_URL value: \"s3://\" - name: ARTIFACT_DIR value: \"/hop/\" - name: RUNNER_USER value: root - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID value: - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY value: \"\" - name: AWS_DEFAULT_REGION value: volumeMounts: - mountPath: /hop name: hop-resources volumes: - name: hop-resources emptyDir: {} jobManager: replicas: 1 resource: memory: \"2g\" cpu: 1 taskManager: resource: memory: \"2g\" cpu: 2 job: jarURI: local:///hop/ parallelism: 4 upgradeMode: stateless entryClass: org.apache.hop.beam.run.MainBeam args: - /hop/ - /hop/hop-metadata.json - Flink Tip: you can provide a 4th argument (in the args list) after the run configuration name: the name of the environment configuration file to use. Please note that the parallelism argument is mandatory in the spec.job section. This parameter is ignored however as our pipeline is executed using Apache Beam. The Flink runner has its own parallelism setting. You can configure this in the pipeline run configuration (called Flink above). In this run configuration you can specify Flink master [auto]. Just as is shown in the Flink operator documentation we can now create this Flink deployment by running the following command. kubectl create -f flink-deployment.yml You can then see the various pods move through their stages of initialisation: kubectl get pods Obviously the first thing that will happen is that we want a Flink job manager. Before starting we’re initializing the hop-resources volume by copying data from S3 with the s3-artifact-fetcher. This leads to an init state: hop-flink-85b8fc7d5f-fkxvq 0/1 Init:0/1 0 2s After a while we’ll start the job manager itself and we’ll end up with this pod status: hop-flink-85b8fc7d5f-fkxvq 1/1 Running 0 45s Once the job manager is ready the job itself will start and (in our case) a task manager will get started as well: $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE flink-kubernetes-operator-6976569cb-68c6g 1/1 Running 0 2d16h hop-flink-85b8fc7d5f-fkxvq 1/1 Running 0 95s hop-flink-taskmanager-1-1 1/1 Running 0 21s To see what’s going on we can do a port forward from the job manager: kubectl port-forward pod/hop-flink-85b8fc7d5f-fkxvq 8081 Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8081 -> 8081 Forwarding from [::1]:8081 -> 8081 Handling connection for 8081 ... You can now browse to localhost:8081 to have a look at the Flink job. To see the detailed logging on the job manager you can run kubectl logs. The logging from the Hop pipeline execution can be found in between the Flink job manager logs: kubectl logs -f pod/hop-flink-85b8fc7d5f-fkxvq ...

Beam File definitions Current limitations Apache Beam is an advanced unified programming model that allows you to implement batch and streaming data processing jobs that run on any execution engine. Popular execution engines are for example Apache Spark, Apache Flink or Google Cloud Platform Dataflow. Apache Beam allows you to create programs in a variety of programming languages like Java, Python and Go using a standard Beam API. These programs build data pipelines which can then be executed using Beam runners on the various execution engines. Hop is using the Beam API to create Beam pipelines based off of your visually designed Hop pipelines. The terminology of Hop and Beam are aligned because they mean the same thing. Hop provides 4 standard ways to execute a pipeline that you designed on Spark, Flink, Dataflow or on the Direct runner. Here is the documentation for the relevant plugins: Beam Spark pipeline engine Beam Flink pipeline engine Beam Dataflow pipeline engine Dataflow pipeline template Beam Direct pipeline engine Hop version Beam version Spark version Flink version 2.9.0 2.56.0 3.4.X (scala 2.12) 1.17.x 2.8.0 2.50.0 3.4.X (scala 2.12) 1.16.x 2.7.0 2.50.0 3.4.X (scala 2.12) 1.16.x 2.6.0 2.50.0 3.4.X (scala 2.12) 1.16.x 2.5.0 2.48.0 3.4.X (scala 2.12) 1.16.x 2.4.0 2.46.0 3.3.X (scala 2.12) 1.15.x 2.3.0 2.43.0 3.3.X (scala 2.12) 1.15.x 2.2.0 2.43.0 3.3.X (scala 2.12) 1.15.x 2.1.0 2.41.0 3.3.0 (scala 2.12) 1.15.2 2.0.0 2.38.0 3.1.3 (scala 2.12) 1.14.4 (scala 2.11) 1.2.0 2.35.0 3.1.2 (scala 2.12) 1.13 (scala 2.11) 1.1.0 2.35.0 3.1.2 1.13 1.0.0 2.32.0 2.4.8 1.11 An Apache Hop pipeline is just metadata. The various beam pipeline engine plugins look at this metadata one transform at a time. It decides what to do with it based on a Hop transform handler which is provided. The transforms are in general split into a different types described below. Important to remember is that Beam pipelines try to solve every action in an 'embarrassingly parallel' way. This means that every transform can and usually will run in more than 1 copy. On large clusters you should expect a lot of copies of the same code to run at any given time. There are a number of Beam specific transforms available which only work on the provided Beam pipeline execution engines. For example: Beam Input which reads text file data from one or more files or Beam BigQuery Output which writes data to BigQuery. You can find these transforms in the Big Data category and their names all start with Beam to make is easy to recognize them. Here is an example of a simple pipeline which read files in a folder (on gs://), filters out data from California, removes and renames a few fields and writes the data back to another set of files: There are a few transforms which are translated into Beam variations: Memory Group By: This transform allows you to aggregate data across large data volumes. When using the Beam engines it uses org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.GroupByKey. Merge Join: You can join 2 data sources with this transform. The main difference is that in the Beam engines the input data doesn’t need to be sorted. The Beam class used to perform this is: org.apache.beam.sdk.extensions.joinlibrary.Join. Generate Rows: This transform is used to generate (empty/static) rows of data. It can be either a fixed number, or it can generate rows indefinitely. When using the Beam engines it uses org.apache.beam.sdk.io.synthetic.SyntheticBoundedSource or org.apache.beam.sdk.io.synthetic.SyntheticUnboundedSource. A few transforms are simply not supported because we haven’t found a good way to do this on Beam yet: Unique Rows Group By : Use the Memory Group By instead Sort Rows The Denormaliser transform works technically correct on Apache Beam in release 1.1.0 and later. Even so you need to consider that the aggregation of the key-value pairs in that transform (in the general case) only happens on a sub-set of the rows. That is because in a Beam pipeline the order in which rows arrive is lost because they are continuously re-shuffled to maximize parallelism. This is different from the behavior of the \"Local\" Hop pipeline engine. To get around this issue you can apply a Memory Group By transform across the whole dataset to grab the first non-null value of every field you de-normalised. This will produce the correct result. All other transforms are simply supported. They are wrapped in a bit of code to make the exact same code that runs on the Hop local pipeline engine work in a Beam pipeline. There are a few things to mention though. Special case Solution Info transforms Some transforms like Stream Lookup read data from other transforms. This is handled by side-inputs for the data in the Beam API and is as such fully supported. Target transforms Sometimes you want to target specific transforms like in Switch Case or Filter Rows. This is fully supported as well and handled by the Beam API which handles additional outputs. Non-Beam input transforms When you’re reading data using a non-beam transform (see Beam specific transforms above) we need to make sure that this transform is executed in exactly one thread. Otherwise, you might read your XML or JSON document many times by the inherently parallel intentions of the various engines. This is handled by doing a Group By over a single value. You’ll see the following in for example your Dataflow pipeline: Create.Values → WithKeys → GroupByKey → Values → Flatten.Iterables → ParDo …​ and all this is just done to make sure we only ever execute our transform once. Non-Beam Output transforms The insistence of a Beam pipeline to run work in an embarrassingly parallel way can trip you up on the output side. In general, it is NOT possible to limit the number of copies of a particular transform. What Hop tries to do is perform a series of operations to try and force a single thread. However, this does not work on all runners. Flink for example insists on doing even this in parallel: GroupByKey(Void) → Values() → Flatten(). You can set the number of copies string of a transform to include SINGLE_BEAM (click on the transform and select Number of copies in the Hop GUI). A better way to deal with this problem is NOT to insist on creating a single file. You can include the unique ID of a transform in the filename with variable ${Internal.Transform.ID}. This will allow the various transform copies to write unique files to the same folder. Row batching with non-Beam transforms A lot of target databases like to receive rows in batches of records. So if you have a transform like for example Table Output or Neo4j Output you might see that performance is not that great. This is because by default the Beam programming model is designed to stream rows of data through a pipeline in bundles and the Hop API only knows about a single record at once. For these transforms you can include BATCH in the number of copies string of a transform click on the transform and select Number of copies in the Hop GUI). For these flagged transforms you can then specify 2 parameters in your Beam pipeline run configurations. When you set these you can determine how long rows are kept behind before being forced to the transforms in question Streaming Hop transform flush interval: how long in time are rows kept and batched up? If you care about latency make this lower (500 or lower). If you have a long-running batching pipeline, make it higher (10000 or higher perhaps). Hop streaming transforms buffer size: how many rows are being batched? Consider making it the same as the batching size you use in your transform metadata (e.g. Table Output, Neo4j Cypher, …​) Please note that these are maximum values. If the end of a bundle is reached in a pipeline rows are always forced to the transform code and as such pushed to the target system. To get an idea of how many times a batching buffer is flushed to the underlying transform code (and as such to for example a remote database) we added a Flushes metric. You will notice this in your metrics view in the Hop GUI when executing. A fat jar is often used to package up all the code you need for a particular project. The Spark, Flink and Dataflow execution engines like it since it massively simplifies the Java classpath when executing pipelines. Apache Hop allows you to create a fat jar in the Hop GUI with the Tools/Generate a Hop fat jar…​ menu or using the following command: sh hop-config.sh -fj /path/to/fat.jar The path to this fat jar can then be referenced in the various Beam runtime configurations. Note that the current version of Hop and all its plugins are used to build the fat jar. If you install or remove plugins or update Hop itself make sure to remember to generate a new fat jar or to update it. The Beam Input and Beam Output transforms expect you to define the layout of the file(s) being read or written. There are some specific advantages to using engines like Spark, Flink and Dataflow. However, with it come some limitations as well…​ Previewing data is not available (yet). Because of the distributed nature of execution we don’t have a great way to acquire preview data. Unit testing: not available for similar reasons compared to previewing or debugging. To test your Beam pipelines pick up data after a pipeline is done and compare that to a golden data set in another pipeline running with a \"Local Hop\" pipeline engine.

Your default Hop installation comes with the samples project by default. If your Hop installation doesn’t come with this project, create a new project and point its Home folder to /config/projects/samples. The Samples project contains the following pipeline run configurations local: the native local run configuration. We’ll be ignoring this run configuration in the context of this guide. Dataflow: the Apache Beam run configuration for Google Cloud Dataflow. Direct: the direct runner Apache Beam run configuration. The Direct Runner executes pipelines on your machine and is designed to validate that pipelines adhere to the Apache Beam model as closely as possible. Instead of focusing on efficient pipeline execution, the Direct Runner performs additional checks to ensure that users do not rely on semantics that are not guaranteed by the model. Flink: the Apache Beam run configuration for Apache Flink. Spark:the Apache Beam run configuration for Apache Spark. Apache Beam requires a so-called fat jar that bundles all required Java classes and their dependencies into a single jar file. Build this jar for your Hop installation through Tools → Generate a Hop fat jar. Save this file in a convenient location and file name. Either store this outside of your project folder or add it to your .gitignore. You don’t want to accidentally add hundreds of MB to your git repository.

In a lot of configurations, this will be a local (locally on the server) runtime configuration, but could be any other runtime configuration, e.g. a Spark runtime configuration that is started from a Spark cluster edge node Server poll delay (ms) The delay in milliseconds between periodic polls to the remote server.

Enable this option if you want to not only send the current pipeline to the server but also the referenced workflows and pipelines. See below for detailed information Named resources reference source folder This is the reference source folder for the named resources that are being used (e.g. ${PROJECT_HOME}). See below for detailed information. Named resources reference target folder This is where you expect the source folder to map to on the server (e.g. /path/on/server). See below for detailed information. This option sends not just the parent pipeline to the server but also all other referenced pipelines and workflows. For example if you have mapping pipelines or workflows referenced they will be sent to the server as well. All the used pipelines and workflows together with the XML presentation of the pipeline execution configuration will be sent over to the server in the form of a ZIP archive. The server receives this archive and without unzipping runs the pipeline. To make this function correctly, Hop changes the references as well as references to filenames. For example ${PROJECT_HOME}/mapping.hpl will be changed to ${Internal.Entry.Current.Folder}/mapping.hpl. This means that it will try to use a relative path to the parent file. If you have are using data files then those file names will be renamed as well. For example, you might be reading a file called ${PROJECT_HOME}/files/bigfile.csv in a CSV File Input transform. During the export the referenced filename will be changed to ${DATA_PATH_1}/bigfile.csv. For every folder that is referenced a new variable will be defined and set in the execution configuration. By default, the path set for this variable will be the same as on the executing (local) machine. On the server this might not make a lot of sense. For this reason you can specify a reference source folder like ${PROJECT_HOME} in combination with a target folder like /server/. In that example variable DATA_PATH_1 will get value /server/files/. This in turn allows you to transfer required files in advance or map a folder into a docker container and so on.

SQRT( A ) SQUARE_ROOT The square root of A. 100 * A / B PERCENT_1 Percentage of A in B. A - ( A * B / 100 ) PERCENT_2 Subtract B% of A. A + ( A * B / 100 ) PERCENT_3 Add B% to A. A + B *C COMBINATION_1 Add A and B times C. SQRT( A*A + B*B ) COMBINATION_2 Calculate ?(A2+B2). ROUND( A ) ROUND_1 Returns the closest Integer to the argument. The result is rounded to an Integer by adding 1/2, taking the floor of the result, and casting the result to type int. In other words, the result is equal to the value of the expression: floor (a + 0.5). In case you need the rounding method \"Round half to even\", use the following method ROUND( A, B ) with no decimals (B=0). ROUND( A, B ) ROUND_2 Round A to the nearest even number with B decimals. The used rounding method is \"Round half to even\", it is also called unbiased rounding, convergent rounding, statistician’s rounding, Dutch rounding, Gaussian rounding, odd-even rounding, bankers' rounding or broken rounding, and is widely used in bookkeeping. This is the default rounding mode used in IEEE 754 computing functions and operators. In Germany it is often called \"Mathematisches Runden\". STDROUND( A ) ROUND_STD_1 Round A to the nearest integer. The used rounding method is \"Round half away from zero\", it is also called standard or common rounding. In Germany it is known as \"kaufmännische Rundung\" (and defined in DIN 1333). STDROUND( A, B ) ROUND_STD_2 Same rounding method used as in STDROUND (A) but with B decimals. CEIL( A ) CEIL The ceiling function map a number to the smallest following integer. FLOOR( A ) FLOOR The floor function map a number to the largest previous integer.

Supports both padded or non-padded input. All fields of this transform support metadata injection. You can use this transform with ETL Metadata Injection to pass metadata to your pipeline at runtime. Use the values in the column \"Function (Metadata Injection view)\" from the table above to specify the operation (Calculation type) applied to the fields. Q: I made a pipeline using A/B in a calculator transform and it rounded wrong: the 2 input fields are integer but my result type was Number(6, 4) so I would expect the integers to be cast to Number before executing the division. If I wanted to execute e.g. 28/222, I got 0.0 instead of 0.1261 which I expected. So it seems the result type is ignored. If I change the input types both to Number(6, 4) I get as result 0.12612612612612611 which still ignores the result type (4 places after the comma). Why is this? A: Length & Precision are just metadata pieces. If you want to round to the specified precision, you should do this in another transform. However: please keep in mind that rounding double point precision values is futile anyway. A floating point number is stored as an approximation (it floats) so 0.1261 (your desired output) could (would probably) end up being stored as 0.126099999999 or 0.1261000000001 (Note: this is not the case for BigNumbers) So in the end we round using BigDecimals once we store the numbers in the output table, but NOT during the pipeline. The same is true for the Text File Output transform. If you would have specified Integer as result type, the internal number format would have been retained, you would press \"Get Fields\" and it the required Integer type would be filled in. The required conversion would take place there and then. In short: we convert to the required metadata type when we land the data somewhere, NOT BEFORE. Q: How do the data types work internally? A: You might notice that if you multiply an Integer and Number, the result is always rounded. That is because Calculator takes data type of the left hand size of the multiplication (A) as the driver for the calculation. As such, if you want more precision, you should put field B on the left hand side or change the data type to Number and all will be well.","title":" Calculator","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"calculator","url":"/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/calculator.html","titles":[{"text":"Description","hash":"_description","id":1},{"text":"Supported Engines","hash":"_supported_engines","id":2},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":3},{"text":"Metadata Injection support","hash":"_metadata_injection_support","id":4},{"text":"FAQ on length and precision and data types affecting the results","hash":"_faq_on_length_and_precision_and_data_types_affecting_the_results","id":5}]},"211":{"id":211,"text":"The Call DB Procedure transform allows you to execute a database procedure (or function) and get the result(s) back.

This transform creates/maintains a technical key out of data with business keys. After passing through this transform all of the remaining data changes for the dimension table can be made as updates, as either a row for the business key already existed or was created. This transform will maintain the key information only. You must update the non-key information in the dimension table, e.g. by putting an update transform (based on technical key) after the combination update/lookup transform. Apache Hop will store the information in a table where the primary key is the combination of the business key fields in the table. Because this process can be slow if you have a large number of fields, a \"hash code\" field is supported that is representing all fields in the dimension. This can speed up lookup performance dramatically while limiting the fields to index to one field only. Hop Engine Spark Flink Dataflow Option Description Transform name Name of the transform.

A cache size of -1 means that caching is disabled. Key fields Specify the names of the keys in the stream and in the dimension table. This will enable the transform to do the lookup. Technical key field This indicates the primary key of the dimension. It is also referred to as Surrogate Key. Creation of technical key Specify howthe technical key is generated, options which are not available for your connection will be grayed out: Use table maximum + 1: A new technical key will be created from the maximum key in the table.

Use sequence: Specify the sequence name if you want to use a database sequence on the table connection to generate the technical key (typical for Oracle e.g.). Use auto increment field: Use an auto increment field in the database table to generate the technical key (supported e.g. by DB2). Remove lookup fields? Enable this option if you want to remove all the lookup fields from the input stream in the output. The only extra field added is then the technical key. Use hashcode This option allows you to generate a hash code, representing all values in the key fields in a numerical form (a signed 64 bit integer). This hash code has to be stored in the table. Date of last update field When required, specify the date of last update field (timestamp) from the source system to be copied to the data warehouse. For example, when you have an address without a primary key. The field will not be part of the lookup fields (nor be part in the hash code calculation).

You can choose to use a Schema Definition or to define the required fields' layout manually. The CSV label for this transform is a misnomer because you can define whatever separator you want to use, such as pipes, tabs, and semicolons; you are not constrained to using commas. Internal processing allows this transform to process data quickly. Options for this transform are a subset of the Text File Input transform. This transform has fewer overall options than the general Text File Input transform, but it has a few advantages over it: NIO — Native system calls for reading the file means faster performance, but it is limited to only local files currently. No VFS support. Parallel running — If you configure this transform to run in multiple copies or in clustered mode, and you enable parallel running, each copy will read a separate block of a single file allowing you to distribute the file reading to several threads or even several slave nodes in a clustered pipeline. Lazy conversion — If you will be reading many fields from the file and many of those fields will not be manipulate, but merely passed through the pipeline to land in some other text file or a database, lazy conversion can prevent Hop from performing unnecessary work on those fields such as converting them into objects such as strings, dates, or numbers. For information on valid date and numeric formats used in this transform, view the Date Formatting Table and Number Formatting Table. Hop Engine Spark Flink Dataflow Option Description Transform name Name of the transform. Filename or the filename field (data from previous transforms) Specify the name of the CSV file to read from. or Select the fieldname that will contain the filename(s) to read from. If this transform receives data from a previous transform, this option is enabled as well as the option to include the filename in the output. Delimiter Specify the file delimiter character used in the target file. Special characters (e.g. CHAR HEX01) can be set with the format $[value], e.g. $[01] or $[6F,FF,00,1F]. Enclosure Specify the enclosure character used in the target file. Special characters (e.g. CHAR HEX01) can be set with the format $[value], e.g. $[01] or $[6F,FF,00,1F]. NIO buffer size This is the size of the read buffer. It represents the amount of bytes that is read in one time from disk. Lazy conversion The lazy conversion algorithm will try to avoid unnecessary data type conversions and can result in a significant performance improvements if this is possible. The typical example that comes to mind is reading from a text file and writing back to a text file. Header row present? Enable this option if the target file’s first line contains a header row with column names. If we mistakenly leave this flag set on files that do not have any columns' names in its first row, Hop will set the column’s name the value found on a specific column for its specific position. In case, for that specific position, the column’s value is empty, Hop will set column’s name to EmptyField_ where n is the position of the column in the columns' set. NOTE: remember also to perform a check on the guessed data types and column’s specifier that was set after the file’s analysis because they could be wrong due to wrong assumptions made by Hop while looking at the sample dataset. Add filename to result Adds the CSV filename(s) read to the result of this pipeline. A unique list is being kept in memory that can be used in the next workflow action in a workflow, for example in another pipeline.

Check this box if you will have multiple instances of this transform running (transform copies) and if you want each instance to read a separate part of the CSV file(s).

See Launching several copies of a transform. Cache size in rows The size of the cache (number of rows), 0 means cache everything. Load all data from table Pre-loads the cache with all the data present in the lookup table. This may improve performance by avoiding database calls. However, if you have a large table, you risk running out of memory. IMPORTANT: In memory look-ups can lead to different results because of the differences in the way your database compares data. For example, if your database table allows case-insensitive comparisons, you may get different results with this option. The same goes for data with trailing spaces. Those are ignored in certain databases when using certain character data types. See more details on the below note about this option. Keys to look up table The keys and conditions to perform the database lookup. Tip: When using the LIKE operator on the key lookup it’s not automatically adding wildcards to the stream value. So by default the LIKE operator is behaving as an \"=\" (see your database for SQL specific topics on the LIKE operator). It is possible to add the wildcards to add a 'Replace in String' transform before the database lookup. In the replace transform select the lookup field then use Regex to look for (^.*) and replace with %$1%. This will add the wildcards to the field for the subsequent lookup task. Values to return table The fields from the lookup table to add to the output stream. \"New name\" allows you to use a different name if the database column name is inappropriate. \"Default\" is the value returned (instead of null) if the lookup fails. Notes: Enabling error handling on the Database Lookup transform will redirect all failed lookup rows to the error handling transform, instead of adding them to the main output steam with null/default values. Type is the type of the output field. When we use Trim type option, the current transform behavior is to trim all the spaces but leave any newline character eventually contained in the string extracted by the transform upon a successful lookup. Do not pass the row if the lookup fails Enable to avoid passing a row when lookup fails. Within the SQL syntax, enabling this would be an INNER JOIN, otherwise it would be an OUTER JOIN. Fail on multiple results? Enable to force the transform to fail if the lookup returns multiple results. Order by If the lookup query returns multiple results, the ORDER BY clause helps you to select the record to take. For example, ORDER BY would allow you to pick the customer with the highest sales volume in a specified state. Get Fields Click to return a list of available fields from the input stream(s) of the transform. Get lookup fields Click to return a list of available fields from the lookup table that can be added to the transform’s output stream. Note on the Load all data from table option: As an example: when storing a value of type \"CHAR(3)\", many databases will store \"ab\" using 3 characters: \"ab \" (notice the blank space). When you do a \"SELECT * FROM my_lookup_table WHERE key_column = 'ab'\", the database is smart and adds a blank space before applying the where clause (it looks for 'ab ' instead of 'ab'). The problem occurs when you use \"load all data from table\" to pre-load the cache: at startup, the cache is built using all the values present in the database, so we store 'ab ' in the cache. Later, looking up 'ab' fails, because the trailing space matters in java equality. Note that this problem does not occur when using the cache, if \"load all data from table\" is disabled. Indeed, the first lookup for 'ab' would find no entry in the cache, call the database (which is smart enough to handle the trailing whitespace problem), get the correct result, and store it in the java cache under the 'ab' key. Thus, the next lookup for 'ab' will find the appropriate result in the cache :)","title":" Database Lookup","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"databaselookup","url":"/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/databaselookup.html","titles":[{"text":"Description","hash":"_description","id":1},{"text":"Supported Engines","hash":"_supported_engines","id":2},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":3}]},"229":{"id":229,"text":"The Data Grid transform allows you to enter a static list of rows in a grid, similar to an in-pipeline spreadsheet.

For example: customer numbers, product id, etc. Stream field Stream field containing the value get from the source system key field. For each of the fields you must have in the dimension, you can specify whether you want the values to be updated (for all versions, this is a Type I operation) or you want to have the values inserted into the dimension as a new version. In the example we used in the screenshot the birth date is something that’s not variable in time, so if the birth date changes, it means that it was wrong in previous versions. It’s only logical then, that the previous values are corrected in all versions of the dimension entry. Option Description Dimension field Fields containing the actual information of a dimension..

Note that the new maximum is always cached, so that the maximum does not need to be calculated for each new row. Use sequence: Specify the sequence name if you want to use a database sequence on the table connection to generate the technical key (typical for Oracle e.g.). Use auto increment field: Use an auto increment field in the database table to generate the technical key (supported e.g. by DB2). These tabs defines the way the record’s version is generated Option Description Version field The name of the field in which to store the version (revision number). Stream Datefield If you have the date at which the dimension entry was last changed, you can specify the name of that field here. It allows the dimension entry to be accurately described for what the date range concerns. If you don’t have such a date, the system date will be taken. When the dimension entries are looked up (Update the dimension is not selected) the date field entered into the stream datefield is used to select the appropriate dimension version based on the date from and date to dates in the dimension record. Date range start field Specify the names of the dimension entries start range. Use an alternative start date? When enabled, you can choose an alternative to the \"Min. Year\"/01/01 00:00:00 date that is used. You can use any of the following: System date: Use the system date as a variable date/time Start date of pipeline: Use the system date, taken at start of the pipeline for the start date Empty (null) value Column value: Select a column from which to take the value. Table date range end The names of the dimension entries end range As a result of the lookup or update operation of this transform type, a field is added to the stream containing the technical key of the dimension. In case the field is not found, the value of the dimension entry for not found (0 or 1, based on the type of database) is returned. A number of optional fields (in the \"Fields\" tab) are automatically managed by the transform. You can specify the table field name in the \"Dimension Field\" column. These are the optional fields: Date of last insert or update (without stream field as source) : adds and manges a Date field Date of last insert (without stream field as source) : adds and manges a Date field Date of last update (without stream field as source) : adds and manges a Date field Last version (without stream field as source) : adds and manges a Boolean field. (converted into Char(1) or boolean database data type depending on your database connection settings and availability of such data type) This acts as a current valid dimension entry entry indicator for the last version: So when a type II attribute changes and a new version is created (to keep track of the history) the 'Last version' attribute in the previous version is set to 'False/N' and the new record with the latest version is set to 'True/Y'. As the name of the transform suggests, the functionality of the transform falls into 2 categories, Lookup and Update…​ In read-only mode (update option is disabled), the transform only performs lookups in a slowly changing dimension. The transform will perform a lookup in the dimension table on the specified database connection and in the specified schema. To do the lookup it uses not only the specified natural keys (with an \"equals\" condition) but also the specified \"Stream datefield\" (see below). The condition that is applied is: \"Start of table date range\" ⇐ \"Stream datefield\" AND \"End of table date range\" > \"Stream datefield\" When no \"Stream datefield\" is specified we use the current system date to find the correct dimension version record. When no row is found, the \"unknown\" key is returned. (The \"unknown\" key will be 0 or 1 depending on whether or not you selected an auto-increment field for the technical key field). Please note that we don’t make a difference between \"Unknown\", \"Not found\", \"Empty\", \"Illegal format\", etc. These nuances can be added manually however. Nothing prevents you from flushing out these types before the data hits this transform with a Filter, regular expression, etc. We suggest you manually add values -1, -2, -3, etc for these special dimension entry cases, just like you would add the specific details of the \"Unknown\" row prior to population of the dimension table. Do not use NULL values for your natural key(s). Null values can’t be compared and are not indexed by most databases. Even if we would support null values in keys (something that doesn’t make a lot of sense anyway), it would most likely cause severe lookup performance problems. Be aware of data conversion issues that occur if you have data types in your input streams that are different from the data types in your natural key(s). If you are have Strings in the transforms input and in the database you use an Integer for example, make sure you are capable of converting the String to number. See it as a best practice to do this before this transform to make sure it works as planned. Another typical example of problems is with floating point number comparisons. Stay away from those. We recommend you use sane data types like Integer or long integers. Stay away from Double, Decimal or catch-all data types like Oracle’s Number (without length or precision; it implicitly uses precision 38 causing us to use the slower BigNumber data type). In update mode (update option is enabled) the transform first performs a lookup of the dimension entry as described in the \"Lookup\" section above. The result of the lookup is different though. Not only the technical key is retrieved from the query, but also the dimension attribute fields. A field-by-field comparison then follows. The result can be one of the following situations: The record was not found, we insert a new record in the table. The record was found and any of the following is true: One or more attributes were different and had an \"Insert\" (Kimball Type II) setting: A new dimension record version is inserted. One or more attributes were different and had a \"Punch through\" (Kimbal Type I) setting: These attributes in all the dimension record versions are updated. One or more attributes were different and had an \"Update\" setting: These attributes in the last dimension record version are updated. All the attributes (fields) were identical: No updates or insertions are performed.

The fields tab is for specifying the fields that must be read from the Excel files. You can choose to use a Schema Definition or to define the required fields' layout manually. Use Get fields from header row to fill in the available fields if the sheets have a header row automatically. The Type column performs type conversions for a given field. For example, if you want to read a date and you have a String value in the Excel file, specify the conversion mask. Note: In the case of Number to Date conversion (for example, 20051028-→ October 28th, 2005) specify the conversion mask yyyyMMdd because there will be an implicit Number to String conversion taking place before doing the String to Date conversion. Option Description Schema Definition Name of the Schema Definition that we want to reference. Name The name of the field. Type The field’s data type; String, Date or Number. Length The length option depends on the field type. Number: total number of significant figures in a number; String: total length of a string; Date: determines how much of the date string is printed or recorded. Precision The precision option depends on the field type, but only Number is supported; it returns the number of floating point digits. Trim type Truncates the field (left, right, both) before processing. Useful for fields that have no static length. Repeat If set to Y, will repeat this value if the field in the next row is empty. Format The format mask (number type). See Text File Input transform and the section \"Number Formats\" for a complete description of format symbols. Currency Symbol used to represent currencies. Decimal A decimal point; this is either a dot or a comma. Grouping A method of separating units of thousands in numbers of four digits or larger. This is either a dot or a comma. This tab retrieves custom metadata fields to add to the transform’s output. The purpose of each field is defined in its name, but you can use these fields for whatever you want.

If this is disabled the output file is always created, regardless of whether rows are actually written to the file. Sheet section Option Description Sheet Name The sheet name the transform will write rows to. Make this the active sheet If checked the Excel file will by default open on the above sheet when opened in MS Excel. If sheet exists in output file The output file already has this sheet (for example when using a template, or writing to existing files), you can choose to write to the existing sheet, or replace it. Protect Sheet The XLS file format allows to protect an entire sheet from changes. If checked you need to provide a password. Excel will indicate that the sheet was protected by the user you provide here. Template section When creating new files (when existing files are replaced, or completely fresh files are created) you may choose to create a copy of an existing template file instead. Please make sure that the template file is of the same type as the output file (both must be xls or xlsx respectively). When creating new sheets, the transform may copy a sheet from the current document (the template or an otherwise existing file the transform is writing to). A new sheet is created if the target sheet is not present, or the existing one shall be replaced as per configuration above.

Since this is not a feature the xls(x) file formats support directly, results may vary. Force formula recalculation If checked, the transform tries to make sure all formula fields in the output file are updated. The xls file format supports a \"dirty\" flag that the transform sets. The formulas are recalculated as soon as the file is opened in MS Excel. For the xlsx file format, the transform must try to recalculate the formula fields itself. Since the underlying POI library does not support the full set of Excel formulas yet, this may give errors. The transform will throw errors if it cannot recalculate the formulas. Leave styles of existing cells unchanged If checked, the transform will not try to set the style of existing cells it is writing to. This is useful when writing to pre-styled template sheets. When writing to existing sheet section Option Description Start writing at end of sheet The transform will try to find the last line of the sheet, and start writing from there. Offset by …​ rows Any non-0 number will cause the transform to move this amount of rows down (positive numbers) or up (negative numbers) before writing rows. Negative numbers may be useful if you need to append to a sheet, but still preserve a pre-styled footer.

It affects workflow if connecting the True or False outcome/hop to another transform. There are 3 path available as outputs (True/False/Main output). The main output follows the True path only. Hop Engine Spark Flink Dataflow Once this transform is connected to a previous transform (one or more and receiving input), you can click on the \"\", \"=\" and \"\" areas to construct a condition. Downstream transforms can be connected to the True or False hop. Right-click a condition to edit, delete, move, or add a sub-condition. You can use a REGEX expression in the \"filter row\" transform. See “Filter Rows” under the Transforms section for more. To enter an IN LIST operator, use a string value separated by semicolons. Lists also works on numeric values like integers. In this case, the list of values must be entered with a string data type, e.g.: 2;3;7;8. Remember that all transforms are executed in parallel, so both true and false paths will run in some cases. The filter rows transform detects only fields in the input stream. If you want to filter rows based on a variable value, you can modify the previous transform. For example, a table input transform can include the variable in the SQL as another field such as “select field1, field2, ${myvar} as field3 from table1”, then in the filter row condition you can say field1 = field3. Alternatively, you can use a ‘Get Variables’ transform to set parameters in fields. There are various SQL query statements that will always return results using IF EXISTS or IS NULL for example if you always require field(s) and results to be returned. An example is found in the samples project called “filter-rows-basic.hpl”. If you cannot select the field you would like because it does not exist yet because of metadata injection, see this doc: https://hop.apache.org//manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/filterrows.html#_mdi_example and the example in the samples project: metadata-injection/filter-rows-mdi-parent.hpl. Essentially, to use an MDI field that is not selectable yet (say in a Filter rows transform), you can setup a transform with a similar field and with a similar condition. Then open the pipeline in a text editor and update the field name to the MDI field name that does not exist yet. Option Description Transform name Optionally, you can change the name of this transform to fit your needs. Send 'true' data to transform The rows for which the condition specified is true are sent to this transform Send 'false' data to transform The rows for which the condition specified are false are sent to this transform The Condition Add Condition Click to add conditions. Add condition converts the original condition into a sub-level condition. * Click a sub-condition to edit it by going down one level in the condition tree. * Right-click a condition to edit, delete, move, or add a sub-condition. The filter rows transform detects only fields in the input stream. If you want to filter rows based on a variable value, you can modify the previous transform like a Table input transform. For example, a table input transform can include the variable in the SQL as another field such as SELECT field1, field2, ${myvar} AS field3 FROM table1 , then in the filter row condition you can say field1 = field3. Alternatively, you can use a ‘Get Variables’ transform to set parameters in fields. You can use a REGEX expression in the \"filter row\" transform. A query: SELECT field1, field2, ${myvar} AS field3 FROM table WHERE field1=xxxx Then in the filter row condition, you can have: field1 = field3 FYI - instead of adding a field to a Table Input as shown above, you can also use a \"Get Variables\" transform to add fields to the stream. You can use a REGEX expression in the \"filter row\" transform. Remember that all transforms are executed in parallel, so both true and false paths will run in some cases. In some cases it will be better to use a where filter in a SQL query than use a Filter rows transform. If you need to return input rows for either case (true/false), you can use various SQL query methods that will always return results using IF EXISTS or IS NULL for example. To filter special characters like explicit EOF (e.g. from old cobol files) Use a REGEX expression in the \"filter row\" transform with the syntax: \"\\x${1A}\" where \\x mean HEX representation and 1A into parenthesis is the EOF char to match in HEX. All fields of this transform support metadata injection. You can use this transform with ETL Metadata Injection to pass metadata to your pipeline at runtime. If you cannot select the field you would like because it does not exist yet because of metadata injection, see this doc: https://hop.apache.org//manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/filterrows.html#_mdi_example and this example in the samples project: metadata-injection/filter-rows-mdi-parent.hpl. Essentially, to use an MDI field that is not selectable yet (say in a Filter rows transform), you can setup a transform with a similar field and with a similar condition. Then open the pipeline in a text editor and update the field name to the MDI field name that does not exist yet. The Filter Rows transform is a special MDI scenario, since it has a nested structure of filter conditions. The condition is given in XML format. The condition XML has the same format as we store the pipeline metadata in a .HPL file in XML format. We do not have a DTD (Document Type Definition) for the .HPL XML format, nor the condition. It is easy to get to an XML condition: Create a sample Filter transform with the different conditions you need. This sample transform gives you all the information, such as the values for the functions you use. Select the transform, copy it to the clipboard, and then paste it into a text editor. Alternatively, you can store the .HPL, and then open the .HPL in a text editor. Find the element and its nested elements and modify it accordingly to use it in your MDI scenario. The samples project demonstrates some concepts in file \"filter-rows-basic.hpl\". The example filter condition below injects the following filter conditions into a Filter Rows transform.

New Field the name of the new field that will be created from the formula. The Formula transform requires a data row to create a new field (if using a transform that queries for rows, you will have to preview it first to generate a row). You can add a row generator with a single row as the first transform in your pipeline. Formula To use a value from a data row field, use square brackets like [field1]. To use a parameter or variable, use the normal syntax ${param1}. If you use a parameter in place of text like with CONCATENATE (see samples) you must put double quotes around it. Example: CONCATENATE([field1], “${Param1}”). * Note: You may have to add quotes around variables in formulas as variables have no type.

Note that the time inside one day is a fraction between 0 and 1, so typical implementations will only be able to compute approximations of the correct time value. Implementations may first perform INT() on the hour, minute, and second before doing the calculation. Therefore, only integer values are portable between implementations. Hours, minutes, and seconds may be arbitrary numbers (they must not be limited to the ranges 0..24, 0..59, or 0..60 respectively). Note that in typical implementations, a value displayed as time has its integer portion discarded and then time is computed; for computational purposes, though, the entire value is retained. constraints None Examples expression result comment TIME(0;0;0) 0 All zero arguments becomes midnight, 12:00:00 AM.

This only returns the date, not the datetime value; if you need the specific time of day as well, use NOW(). constraints None Examples expression result comment TODAY()>DATE(2006;1;3) True Every date TODAY() changes, but we know it’s beyond this date. INT(TODAY())=TODAY() True TODAY() returns an integer. WARNING: this test is allowed to fail if the locale transitions through midnight while computing this test; because TODAY() is referenced twice, in some implementations this would result in a race condition) This is incredibly unlikely to occur in practice. description Extract the day of the week from a date; if text, uses current locale to convert to a date. syntax WEEKDAY( DateParam Date [ ; Integer Type = 1 ] ) returns Number semantics Returns the day of the week from a date, as a number from 0 through 7. The exact meaning depends on the value of Type: 1.When Type is 1, Sunday is the first day of the week, with value 1; Saturday has value 7. 2.When Type is 2, Monday is the first day of the week, with value 1; Sunday has value 7. 3.When Type is 3, Monday is the first day of the week, with value 0; Sunday has value 6. constraints None Examples expression result comment WEEKDAY(DATE(2006;5;21)) 1 Year-month-date format WEEKDAY(DATE(2005;1;1)) 7 Saturday.

For example, the week containing January 1 is the first week of the year, and is numbered week 1. There are two systems used for this function: System 1 The week containing January 1 is the first week of the year, and is numbered week 1. System 2 The week containing the first Thursday of the year is the first week of the year, and is numbered as week 1. This system is the methodology specified in ISO 8601, which is commonly known as the European week numbering system. syntax WEEKNUM(serial_number,[return_type]) returns Integer semantics constraints Examples expression result comment WEEKNUM(\"3/9/2012\") 10 Number of the week in the year that 3/9/2012 occurs, based on weeks beginning on Sunday (default).

Working days exclude weekends and any dates identified as holidays. Use WORKDAY to exclude weekends or holidays when you calculate invoice due dates, expected delivery times, or the number of days of work performed. syntax WORKDAY(start_date, days, [holidays]) returns semantics constraints Examples expression result comment WORKDAY([DATE_FIELD],[NB_DAYS_FIELD]) description Extract the year from a date given in the current locale of the application. syntax YEAR( DateParam D ) returns Number semantics Parses a date-formatted string in the current locale’s format and returns the year portion. If a year is given as a two-digit number, as in \"05-21-15\", then the year returned is either 1915 or 2015, depending upon the a break point in the calculation context. In an OpenDocument document, this break point is determined by table:null-year. Applications shall support extracting the year from a date beginning in 1900. Three-digit year numbers precede adoption of the Gregorian calendar, and may return either an error or the year number. Four-digit year numbers preceding 1582 (inception of the Gregorian Calendar) may return either an error or the year number. Four-digit year numbers following 1582 should return the year number. constraints None Examples expression result comment YEAR(DATE(1904;1;1)) 1904 Extracts year from a given date. description YEARFRAC calculates the fraction of the year represented by the number of whole days between two dates (the start_date and the end_date). For instance, you can use YEARFRAC to identify the proportion of a whole year’s benefits, or obligations to assign to a specific term. syntax YEARFRAC(start_date, end_date, [basis]) returns semantics constraints Examples expression result comment YEARFRAC(\"1/1/2012\",\"7/30/2012\") 0.58055556 Fraction of the year between 1/1/2012 and 7/30/12, omitting the Basis argument. YEARFRAC(\"1/1/2012\",\"7/30/2012\",1) 0.57650273 Fraction between same dates, using the Actual/Actual basis argument. Because 2012 is a Leap year, it has a 366 day basis.

You can use PV with either periodic, constant payments (such as a mortgage or other loan), or a future value that’s your investment goal. syntax PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type]) returns Number semantics constraints Examples expression result comment PV([FIELD2]/12, 12*[FIELD3], [FIELD1], , 0) ($59,777.15) Present value of an annuity with the terms in [FIELD1]:[FIELD3]. description Uses an index to return a value from a list of values. Uses index_num to return a value from the list of value arguments. Use CHOOSE to select one of up to 254 values based on the index number. For example, if value1 through value7 are the days of the week, CHOOSE returns one of the days when a number between 1 and 7 is used as index_num. syntax CHOOSE( Integer Index ; { Any Value }+ ) returns Any semantics Uses Index to determine which value, from a list of values, to return. If Index is 1, CHOOSE returns the first Value; if Index is 2, CHOOSE returns the second value, and so on. Note that the Values may be formula expressions.

If all parameters are False, it shall return False; if any are True, it shall returns True. When given one parameter, this has the effect of converting that one parameter into a logical value. When given zero parameters, applications may return a Logical value or an error. Also in array context a logical OR of all arguments is computed, range or array parameters are not evaluated as a matrix and no array is returned. This behavior is consistent with functions like SUM. To compute a logical OR of arrays per element use the + operator in array context. constraints Must have 1 or more parameters Examples expression result comment OR(FALSE(),FALSE()) False Simple OR. OR(FALSE(),TRUE()) True Simple OR. OR(TRUE(),FALSE()) True Simple OR. OR(TRUE(),TRUE()) True Simple OR. OR(FALSE(),NA()) NA Returns an error if given one.

OR(TRUE()) True One parameter okay - simply returns it description Returns constant TRUE syntax TRUE() returns Logical semantics Returns logical constant TRUE. Although this is syntactically a function call, semantically it is a constant, and typical applications optimize this because it is a constant. Note that this may or may not be equal to 1 when compared using “=”. It always has the value of 1 if used in a context requiring Number (because of the automatic conversions), so if ISNUMBER(TRUE()), then it must have the value 1. constraints Must have 0 parameters Examples expression result comment TRUE() True Constant.

If decimalPlaces is not provided defaults to 3. omitGroupChar indicates if the grouping character (for example \",\") should be omitted from the result. Defaults to false. constraints None Examples expression result comment FIXED([NUMBER_FIELD]], 1) 1,234.6 Rounds the number in [NUMBER_FIELD] one digit to the right of the decimal point. FIXED([NUMBER_FIELD]], -1, TRUE) -1230 Rounds the number in [NUMBER_FIELD] one digit to the left of the decimal point, without commas (the TRUE argument).

If Length is omitted, it defaults to 1; otherwise, it computes Length=INT(Length). If T has fewer than Length characters, it returns T. This means that if T is an empty string (which has length 0) or the parameter Length is 0, LEFT() will always return an empty string. Note that if Length= 0 Examples expression result comment LEFT(\"Hello\";2) \"He\" Simple LEFT(). LEFT(\"Hello\";2.9) \"He\" INT(), not round to nearest or round towards positive infinity, must be used to convert length into an integer. LEFT(\"Hello\") \"H\" Length defaults to 1. LEFT(\"Hello\";20) \"Hello\" If Length is longer than T, returns T. LEFT(\"Hello\";0) \"\" If Length 0, returns empty string. LEFT(\"\";4) \"\" Given an empty string, always returns empty string. LEFT(\"xxx\";-0.1) Error It makes no sense to request a negative number of characters. Also, this tests to ensure that INT() is used to convert non-integers to integers; if -0.1 were incorrectly rounded to 0 (as it would be by round-to-nearest or round-toward-zero), this would incorrectly return a null string. LEFT(\"Hello\";2^15-1) \"Hello\" If Length > LEN(T) entire string is returned. description Return the length, in characters, of given text syntax LEN( Text T ) returns Integer semantics Computes number of characters (not the number of bytes) in T. Implementations that support ISO 10646 / Unicode shall consider any character in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) basic plane as one character, even if they occupy multiple bytes. (The BMP are the characters numbered 0 through 65535 inclusive). Implementations should consider any character not in the BMP as one character as well. constraints None.

As with most functions, it is side-effect free (it does not modify the source values). All implementations shall convert A-Z to a-z. However, as this function can be locale aware, results may be unexpected in certain cases. For example in a Turkish locale an upper case \"I without dot\" U+0049 is converted to a lower case \"i without dot\" U+0131. constraints None Examples expression result comment LOWER(\"HELLObc7\") \"hellobc7\" Uppercase converted to lowercase; other characters just copied to result. description MID returns a specific number of characters from a text string, starting at the position you specify, based on the number of characters you specify. syntax MID(text, start_num, num_chars) returns String semantics constraints Examples expression result comment MID([FIELD],1,5) Returns 5 characters from the string in [FIELD], starting at the 1st character. MID([FIELD],7,20) Returns 20 characters from the string in [FIELD], starting at the 7th character. Because the number of characters to return (20) is greater than the length of the string (10), all characters, beginning with the 7th, are returned. No empty characters (spaces) are added to the end.

MID(\"123456789\";-1;0) Error Start cannot be less than one; even if the length is 0 MID(\"123456789\";1;0) \"\" But otherwise, length=0 produces the empty string MID(\"123456789\";2.9;1) \"2\" INT(Start) is used MID(\"123456789\";2;2.9) \"23\" INT(Length) is used description Returns extracted text, given an original text, starting position, and length. syntax MID( Text T ; Integer Start ; Integer Length ) returns Text semantics Returns the characters from T, starting at character position Start, for up to Length characters. For the integer conversions, Start=INT(Start), and Length=INT(Length). If there are less than Length characters starting at start, it returns as many characters as it can beginning with Start. In particular, if Start > LEN(T), it returns the empty string (\"\"). If Start =0, and Length=0, it returns the empty string. Note that MID(T;1;Length) produces the same results as LEFT(T;Length). constraints Start >= 1, Length >= 0. Examples expression result comment MID([FIELD],1,5) Returns 5 characters from the string in [FIELD], starting at the 1st character. MID([FIELD],7,20) Returns 20 characters from the string in [FIELD], starting at the 7th character.

As with most functions, it is side-effect free (it does not modify the source values). constraints None Examples expression result comment PROPER(\"hello there\") Hello There The first letter is uppercase and the following letter are lowercase. description Returns text where an old text is substituted with a new text. syntax REPLACE( Text T ; Number Start ; Number Len ; Text New ) returns Text semantics Returns text T, but remove the characters starting at character position Start for Len characters, and instead replace them with New. Character positions defined by Start begin at 1 (for the leftmost character). If Len=0, the text New is inserted before character position Start, and all the text before and after Start is retained. constraints Start >= 1.

If Length is omitted, it defaults to 1; otherwise, it computes Length=INT(Length). If T has fewer than Length characters, it returns T (unchanged). This means that if T is an empty string (which has length 0) or the parameter Length is 0, RIGHT() will always return an empty string. Note that if Length= 0 Examples expression result comment RIGHT(\"Hello\";2) \"lo\" Simple RIGHT(). RIGHT(\"Hello\") \"o\" Length defaults to 1. RIGHT(\"Hello\";20) \"Hello\" If Length is longer than T, returns T. RIGHT(\"Hello\";0) \"\" If Length 0, returns empty string. RIGHT(\"Hello\";2^15-1) “Hello” If Length is larger than T and is very large, it still returns the original short string. RIGHT(\"\";4) \"\" Given an empty string, always returns empty string.

RIGHT(\"Hello\";-0.1) Error Must use INT, not round-to-nearest or round-towards zero, to convert Length to Integer description Converts an arabic numeral to roman, as text. syntax ROMAN(number, [form]) returns Text semantics constraints Examples expression result comment ROMAN(499,0) CDXCIX Classic roman numeral style for 499 (CDXCIX) ROMAN(499,1) LDVLIV More concise version for 499 (LDVLI ROMAN(499,2) XDIX More concise version for 499 (XDIX) ROMAN(499,3) VDIV More concise version for 499 (VDIV) ROMAN(499,4) ID Simplified version for 499 (ID) description Looks for a string of text within another (NOT case sensitive) syntax SEARCH( Text findText, Text text, Integer startPosition ) returns Text semantics findText is the text to search for, text is the String to search in, startPosition is the integer position within the string to start searching constraints startPosition > 0 Examples expression result comment SEARCH(\"p\";\"Apple\") 2 SEARCH(\"p\";\"Apple\";3) 3 Starts searching at index 3 description Counts the occurrences of text in a string. syntax SEARCH( Text text, Text findText ) returns Text semantics text is the String to search in, findText is the text to search for. constraints None Examples expression result comment STRINGCOUNT(\"Apple\";\"p\") 2 STRINGCOUNT(\"APPLE\";\"p\") 0 Function is case sensitive description Returns text where an old text is substituted with a new text. syntax SUBSTITUTE( Text T ; Text Old ; Text New [ ; Number Which ] ) returns Text semantics Returns text T, but with text Old replaced by text New (when searching from the left). If Which is omitted, every occurrence of Old is replaced with New; if Which is provided, only that occurrence of Old is replaced by New (starting the count from 1). If there is no match, or if Old has length 0, the value of T is returned. Note that Old and New may have different lengths. If Which is present and Which = 1 (when provided) Examples expression result comment SUBSTITUTE(\"121212\";\"2\";\"ab\") \"1ab1ab1ab\" Without Which, all replaced. SUBSTITUTE(\"121212\";\"2\";\"ab\";2) \"121ab12\" Which starts counting from 1. SUBSTITUTE(\"Hello\";\"x\";\"ab\") \"Hello\" If not found, returns unchanged. SUBSTITUTE(\"xyz\";\"\";\"ab\") \"xyz\" Returns T if Old is Length 0. SUBSTITUTE(\"\";\"\";\"ab\") \"\" Returns T if Old is Length 0, even if T is empty (it does not consider an empty T to “match” an empty Old).

This is not a type-conversion function; T(5) produces an empty string, not \"5\". constraints None Examples expression result comment T(\"HI\") \"HI\" T does not change text. T([.B3]) \"7\" References transformed into what they reference. T(5) \"\" Non-text converted into null string. description Return the value converted to a text. syntax TEXT( Scalar X ; Text FormatCode ) returns Text semantics Converts the value X to a text according to the rules of a number format code passed as FormatCode and returns it. constraints The FormatCode is a sequence of characters with an application-defined meaning. Portable Contraints: The result of this function may change across locales. If separators such as decimal or group separator are involved, conversion may give unexpected results if the separators don’t match that of the current locale. Across applications the result may change to the extend to which number format codes and their subtleties are supported. Portable documents should not use this function. Examples expression result comment TEXT(12345.6789;\",#0.00\") \"12,345.68\" Non-text converted to text. This is locale-specific.

As with most functions, it is side-effect free (it does not modify the source values). All implementations shall convert a-z to A-Z. However, as this function can be locale aware, results may be unexpected in certain cases, for example in a Turkish locale a lower case \"i with dot\" U+0069 is converted to an upper case \"I with dot\" U+0130. constraints None Examples expression result comment UPPER(\"Habc7\") \"HABC7\" Lowercase converted to upper case; other characters just copied to result. description Applies URL-Encoding to a text given in the first parameter using the encoding specified in the second parameter.

Fuzzy Match transform finds strings that potentially match using duplicate-detecting algorithms that calculate the similarity of two streams of data. This transform returns matching values as a separated list as specified by user-defined minimal or maximal values. Hop Engine Spark Flink Dataflow Option Description Transform name Name of this transform as it appears in the pipeline workspace Lookup transform Identifies the transform that contains the fields to match Lookup field Identifies the field to match Main stream field Identifies the primary stream to match the Lookup field with Algorithm Identifies which string-matching algorithm to use---options include Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein, Needleman Wunsch, Jaro, Jaro Winkler, Pair letters similarity, Metaphone, Double Metaphone, SoundEx, or Refined SoundEx Case sensitive Identifies if streams can or cannot differ based on the use of uppercase and lowercase letters---only for use with the Levenshtein algorithms Get closer value When checked, returns a single result with the highest similarity score---when unchecked, returns all matches that satisfy the minimal and maximal value setting as a separated list, separated by the values separator Minimum value Identifies the lowest possible similarity score Maximal value Identifies the highest possible similarity score Values separator Identifies the string that separate the matches. Only available for specific algorithms and when the Get closer value option is unchecked. Algorithm Definitions Within the Algorithm field, there are several options available to compare and match strings. Levenshtein and Damerau-Levenshtein: calculate the distance between two strings by looking at how many edit transforms are needed to get from one string to another. The former only looks at inserts, deletes, and replacements. The latter adds transposition. The score indicates the minimum number of changes needed. For instance, the difference between John and Jan would be two; to turn the name John into Jan you need one transform to replace the O with an A, and another transform to delete the H. Needleman Wunsch: calculates the similarity of two sequences and is mainly used in bioinformatics. The algorithm calculates a gap penalty. The aforementioned example would have a score of negative two. Jaro and Jaro Winkler: calculate a similarity index between two strings. The result is a fraction between zero, indicating no similarity, and one, indicating an identical match. Pair letters similarity: dissects the two strings in pairs and calculates the similarity of the two strings by dividing the number of common pairs by the sum of the pairs from both strings. Metaphone, Double Metaphone, SoundEx, and Refined SoundEx: are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_algorithm#:~:text=A%20phonetic%20algorithm%20is%20an,indexing%20words%20in%20other%20languages.[phonetic algorithms], which try to match strings based on how they would sound. Each is based on the English language and would not be useful to compare other languages. The Metaphone algorithm returns an encoded value based on the English pronunciation of a given word. The encoded value of the names John and Jan would return the value JN for both names. The Double Metaphone algorithm has fundamental design improvements over its predecessor and uses a more complex ruleset for coding. It can return a primary and a secondary encoded value for a string. The names John and Jan each return metaphone key values of JN and AN. The Soundex algorithm returns a single encoded value for a name that consists of a letter followed by three numerical digits. The letter is the first letter of the name, and the digits encode the remaining consonants. The Refined SoundEx algorithm is an improvement over its predecessor.

Get Data From XML can read data from 3 kind of sources (files, stream and url) in 2 modes (user can define files and urls at static mode or in a dynamic way). See also: XML Input Stream (StAX) transform. Samples (Samples project): transforms/get-data-from-xml.hpl Hop Engine Spark Flink Dataflow The files tab is where you define the location of the XML files from which you want to read. The table below contains options associated with the Files tab. Option Description Transform name Name of the transform. XML Source from field XML source is defined in a field : the previous transform is giving XML data in a certain field in the input stream. XML source is a filename : the previous transform is giving filenames in a certain field in the input stream. These are read. Read source as URL : the previous transform is giving URLs in a certain field in the input stream. These are read. Get XML source from a field : specify the field to read XML, filename or URL from. File or directory Specifies the location and/or name of the input text file. Click Add to add the file/directory/wildcard combination to the list of selected files (grid) below. Regular expression Specifies the regular expression you want to use to select the files in the directory specified in the previous option. Selected Files Contains a list of selected files (or wildcard selections) and a property specifying if file is required or not. If a file is required and it is not found, an error is generated;otherwise, the file name is skipped. Show filename(s)…​ Displays a list of all files that will be loaded based on the current selected file definitions Option Description Settings Loop XPath : For every \"Loop XPath\" location we find in the XML file(s), we will output one row of data. This is the main specification we use to flatten the XML file(s). You can use the \"Get XPath nodes\" button to search for the possible repeating nodes in the XML document. Please note that if the XML document is large that this can take a while. Encoding : the XML filename encoding in case none is specified in the XML documents. (yes, those still exist) Namespace aware : check this to make the XML document namespace aware. Ignore comments : Ignore all comments in the XML document while parsing. Validate XML : Validate the XML prior to parsing. Use a token when you want to replace dynamically in a Xpath field value. A token is between @_ and - (@_fieldname-). Please see the Example 1 to see how it works. Use token : a token is not related tro XML parsing but to Hop. Igore empty file : an empty file is not a valid XML document. Check this if you want to ignore those altogether. Do not raise an error if no file: Don’t raise a stink if no files are found. Limit : Limits the number of rows to this number (zero (0) means all rows). Prune path to handle large files: almost the same value as the \"Loop XPath\" property with some exceptions. Use the prune path to speed up processing of large files, or consider using the XML Input Stream (StAX) transform. Note that you can use this parameter to avoid multiple HTTP URL requests. Additional fields Include filename in output? : Allows you to specify a field name to include the file name (String) in the output of this transform. Rownum in output? : Allows you to specify a field name to include the row number (Integer) in the output of this transform. Add to result filename Add files to result filename : Adds the XML filenames read to the result of this pipeline. A unique list is being kept in memory that can be used in the next workflow action in a workflow, for example in another pipeline.

As described above, if you enable the switch in the Filter tab, Hop will raise an exception in case no files are found and will stop the process. In this case, we need to be aware about two different ways the exceptions are raised depending on the way you choose to identify the set of files you are looking for. If you specified the files (or the inclusion/exclusion expressions) as a set in the Selected files table, the files retrieval is performed by considering the entire set specified (all at once) and the exception is raised in no files are found. If you specified the files by going through the Filenames from field option, the details about the files that we are going to retrieve comes in the incoming rows. That means that the retrieval is done row by row and as soon as one of the details used to specify the searched files fails the exception is raised. Therefore, in this case, the evaluation to fire the exception is done after the evaluation of each single incoming row and not evaluating the overall dataset returned and generated by the details found in the incoming rows.","title":" Get filenames","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"getfilenames","url":"/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/getfilenames.html","titles":[{"text":"Description","hash":"_description","id":1},{"text":"Supported Engines","hash":"_supported_engines","id":2},{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage","id":3},{"text":"File tab","hash":"_file_tab","id":4},{"text":"Filters","hash":"_filters","id":5},{"text":"Details on how exceptions are raised when no files are found","hash":"_details_on_how_exceptions_are_raised_when_no_files_are_found","id":6}]},"258":{"id":258,"text":"The Get Files Row Count transform counts the number of rows in a file or set of files.

You only need to use this transform if you need the variable value in a field. If you need to refer to a previous pipeline’s data row(s) fields, then use a Get rows from result transform. Hop Engine Spark Flink Dataflow Note that workflow/environment variables are set only once. A pipeline needs to start to get any new variables. A running or sequential or nested (nested pipelines are technically the same pipeline) pipeline can’t fetch new variable values. A pipeline is considered started when a pipeline starts for every row in a pipeline executor. Refer to parameters/variables using the syntax: ${myVariable}, for example from a previous pipeline. Two ways to pass fields, parameters to variables downstream: Parameters must be unique per pipeline (case is not a differentiator). The pipeline executor parameter value takes precedence over the pipeline’s properties parameter value. The sending parameter value takes precedence over the default value of the receiving pipeline’s properties parameter. Use a pipeline executor transform or a Repeat action: Send: add fields on the Parameters tab (parameter name can be same as field name) to send. Receive: in the immediate downstream pipeline, use Get variables to set variables/fields from Parameters using format: ${myParam} Edit any upstream pipeline’s properties: Send: Add a parameter on the parameters tab of a pipeline’s properties (Edit pipeline icon), and optionally give it a default value. The parameter value can be set in a pipeline using various transforms. Receive: in the immediate downstream pipeline, use Get variables to set variables/fields from Parameters using format: ${myParam} Other: See also the Set Variables transform. To convert the Variable into a data type other than String use Select Values - Meta Data tab. To get system values, including command line arguments, use the Get System Info transform.

The code you type in the script area is executed once for each input row. Variables won’t be usable or testable until you create fields. Click the “Get variables” button to convert script variables into fields. Hop Engine Spark Flink Dataflow The JavaScript transform provides a user interface for building JavaScript expressions that you can use to modify your data. The code you type in the script area is executed once for each input row. The transform allows multiple scripts in a single transform instance. The Javascript transform is not an input transform and therefore requires an input stream from the pipeline. Minimizing scripting is very important to keep your data integration solutions maintainable. Try to avoid using JavaScript as much as possible. Hop uses an older version of JavaScript (Rhino engine) which is ECMA 5 and a bit of ECMA 6. See Rhino ES2015/ES6, ES2016 and ES2017 support at https://mozilla.github.io/rhino/compat/engines.html The Get variables button may not always work, so enter variables manually. The JavaScript transform runs better with less whitespace and less line continuations, especially when using GraphQL. Avoid multi-line expressions or statements. Ensure you select the correct Type for the outgoing JavaScript fields. E.g. JavasScript to create 4 new fields: var myVar = incomingFieldFromHop; var myTestString = \"my test\"; var myDate = str2date(\"2020-12-31\", \"yyyy-MM-dd\"); var myDateTime = new Date(\"2023-10-01T01:40:26.210\"); E.g. JavaScript to flatten JSON keys: //var input_json = { // \"c-102\": \"AIDS Healthcare\", // \"c-105\": \"AIDS Healthcare Direct\", // \"c-75\": \"Allied Physicians (ALIP)\", // \"c-59\": \"Asheville Endocrinology\"}; var input_json = JSON.parse(incomingJSONFromHop); var output_json = []; for (var key in input_json) { var value = input_json[key]; output_json.push({field1: key, field2: value }); } var flattened_json = JSON.stringify(output_json); The Javascript functions panel contains a tree view of scripts, constants, functions, input fields, and output fields as described below. Double click on any of the scripts, constants, functions or fields to add them to the script. Transform Scripts Scripts you have created in this transform. Transform Constants A number of pre-defined, static constants that control what happens to the data rows. To use these constants, you must first set a pipeline_Status variable to CONTINUE_PIPELINE at the beginning of the script, so that the variable assignment is made to the first row being processed. Otherwise, any subsequent assignments to the pipeline_Status variable are ignored. The available constants are: SKIP_PIPELINE: Excludes the current row from the output row set and continues processing on the next row. ERROR_PIPELINE: Excludes the current row from the output row set, generates an error, and any remaining rows are not processed. CONTINUE_PIPELINE: Includes the current row in the output row set. ABORT_PIPELINE: Excludes the current row from the output row set, and any remaining rows are not processed, but does not generate an error. Transform Functions String, numeric, date, logic, special, and file functions you can use in scripts. These included functions are implemented in Java and execute faster than JavaScript functions. Each function has a sample script demonstrating its use. Double-click the function to add it to the Javascript pane. Right-click and choose Sample to add the sample to the Javascript pane. Input Fields Input fields for the transform. Output Fields Output fields for the transform. The Javascript pane is the editing area for writing your code. You can insert constants, functions, input fields, and output fields from the Javascript functions panel on the left by double-clicking the node you want to insert or by using drag-and-drop to place the object onto the Javascript panel. The position at the bottom of the Javascript panel displays the line number and position of the cursor. The Optimization level selects the level of JavaScript optimization. The values are: 1: JavaScript runs in interpreted mode. 0: No optimizations are performed. 1-9: All optimizations are performed. 9 performs the most optimization with faster script execution, but compiles slower. The default is 9. You can right-click a tab in the Javascript panel to open a context menu with the following commands: Add new – Add a new script tab. Add copy – Add a copy of the existing script in a new tab. Set Transform Script - Specify the script to execute for each incoming row. Only one tab can be set as a transform script. The first tab is a transform script by default. Set Start Script - Specify the script to execute before processing the first row. Set End Script – Specify the script to execute after the last row has been processed. Remove Script Type - Specify to not execute the script. The script tab is not removed. To remove a script tab, click the Close button (the red “X”) and choose Yes to delete the script tab. The icon for the script type displays on the tab to denote the type of script on the tab. To rename a script tab, right-click the tab name in the Transform Scripts section of the Javascript functions panel, choose Rename, and enter the new name. The Fields table contains a list of variables from your script, and enables you to add metadata to the fields, like descriptive names. Field Description Fieldname Specify the name of the incoming field. Rename to Specify a new name for the incoming field. Type Specify a data type for the output field. Length Specify the length of the output field. Precision Specify the precision value of the output field. Replace value ‘Fieldname’ or ‘Rename to’ Specify whether to replace the value of the selected field with another value or to rename a field. The values are Y (Yes) and N (No). Get variables Retrieve a list of Javascript variables from your script. You can manually add variables as the ‘Get variables’ button may not always work. Test Script Test the syntax of your script, and displays the Generate Rows dialog box with a set of rows for testing. You can use the following internal API objects (for reference see the classes in the source): PipelineName: A String holding the pipeline name transform: the actual transforms instance for this transform (org.apache.hop.pipeline.transforms.javascript.ScriptValues) rowMeta: The actual instance of org.apache.hop.core.row.IRowMeta row: The actual instance of the data Object[] var idx = getInputRowMeta().indexOfValue(\"lookup\"); if ( idx < 0 ) { var lookupValue = 0; } else { var lookupValue = row[idx]; } Fields must be added to the rows in the same order to keep the structure of the row coherent. To add a field, define it as var in the Javascript pane, and add it as a field in the Fields table. Most values that are assigned in JavaScript are floating point values by default, even if you think you have assigned an integer value. If you are having trouble using == or switch/case on values that you know are integers, use the following constructs: switch(parseInt(valuename)) { case 1: case 2: case 3: strvalueswitch = \"one, two, three\"; break; case 4: strvalueswitch = \"four\"; break; default: strvalueswitch = \"five\"; } To filter rows (remove the rows from the output for example) set the pipeline_Status variable as follows: pipeline_Status = CONTINUE_PIPELINE if (/* your condition here */) pipeline_Status = SKIP_PIPELINE All rows matching the specified condition are removed from the output. Javascript does not allow you to create variables with spaces in the variable name. However, you can work with field names that contain spaces. For example, to replace all spaces with underscores in a field field name with spaces, use the syntax this[\"field name with spaces\"]. The this keyword is required. Without it, Javascript will use field name with spaces as a character array. var new_field = replace(this[\"field name with spaces\"], \" \", \"_\"); You can create your own custom json structure with a javascript similar to this one. For this example you need to create two input fields short_filename and myField1 i.e. by using a data grid transform. The resulting JSON \"myBodyJson\" can then be used i.e. in a REST Client transform. For a POST request just map this \"myBodyJson\" to \"Body field\". var json = {}; json.sourceProperties = {}; json.sourceProperties.properties = []; json.filename = short_filename; json.sourceCategory = \"CategoryABC\"; json.sourceProperties.properties.push({\"key\": \"exampleArr\", \"values\": [1000]}) json.sourceProperties.properties.push({\"key\": \"exampleString\", \"values\": \"Some Testingtext\"}) json.sourceProperties.properties.push({\"key\": \"exampleUsingInputField\", \"values\": myField1}) var myBodyJson = JSON.stringify(json);","title":" JavaScript","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"javascript","url":"/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/javascript.html","titles":[{"text":"Description","hash":"_description","id":1},{"text":"Supported Engines","hash":"_supported_engines","id":2},{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage","id":3},{"text":"Troubleshooting","hash":"_troubleshooting","id":4},{"text":"Examples","hash":"_examples","id":5},{"text":"Javascript functions Panel","hash":"_javascript_functions_panel","id":6},{"text":"Javascript Panel","hash":"_javascript_panel","id":7},{"text":"Script types","hash":"_script_types","id":8},{"text":"Fields table","hash":"_fields_table","id":9},{"text":"Javascript Internal API Objects","hash":"_javascript_internal_api_objects","id":10},{"text":"Examples","hash":"_examples_2","id":11},{"text":"Check for the Existence of Fields in a row:","hash":"_check_for_the_existence_of_fields_in_a_row","id":12},{"text":"Add a New Field in a Row","hash":"_add_a_new_field_in_a_row","id":13},{"text":"Numeric values","hash":"_numeric_values","id":14},{"text":"Filter Rows","hash":"_filter_rows","id":15},{"text":"Use field names with spaces","hash":"_use_field_names_with_spaces","id":16},{"text":"Produce a custom JSON including nested arrays","hash":"_produce_a_custom_json_including_nested_arrays","id":17}]},"277":{"id":277,"text":"The JDBC Metadata transform allows you to fetch metadata from a database connection, this includes schemas, tables and other objects.

E.g. for Date: yyyy-MM-dd. You can either select a format from the dropdown or enter format text directly. Hop uses SimpleDateFormat (Java Platform SE 8) at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html Examples of Timestamp formats: Format: yyyy-MM-dd’T’HH:mm:ss.SSSZ and Result: 2021-10-26T20:51:43.795+0000 Format: 2024-04-22T00:00:00.000Z and Result: 2024-04-22T00:00:00.000Z Regex You can use Regex in the Path expression. Example Path to filter on those that start with the letter 'a': $.data[?(@=~/a.*/i)] The Additional output fields tab contains the following options to specify additional information about the file to process: Option Description Short filename field Specify the field that contains the filename without path information but with an extension. Extension field Specify the field that contains the extension of the filename. Path field Specify the field that contains the path in operating system format. Size field Specify the field that contains the size of the data. Is hidden field Specify the field indicating if the file is hidden or not (Boolean). Last modification field Specify the field indicating the date of the last time the file was modified. Uri field Specify the field that contains the URI. Root uri field Specify the field that contains only the root part of the URI. While processing input JSON files, if a JSON record has one or more field containing null values, by default the null values will be present in the transform output. For example if we have a JSON file like this { \"persons\" : [ { \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"name 1\" }, { \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"name 2\" }, { \"id\": \"3\", \"name\": null }, { \"id\": \"4\", \"name\": \"name 4\" } ] } When extracting the fields id and Name using the following field definition: Field name Json Path id $.persons.*.id Name $.persons.*.name given the default behavior, the output will be id;Name 1;Name 1 2;Name 2 3;null 4;Name 4 Now let’s only select the name field and see what happens Name Name 1 Name 2 Name 4 You will notice that you only have 3 rowsets returned in this case ( the null line is omited from the result) To change Hop’s behavior regarding null values in JSON files, so that null values will not be considered in JSON output, you change the HOP_JSON_INCLUDE_NULLS configuration variable and set it’s value to N HOP_JSON_INPUT_INCLUDE_NULLS = N After restaring Hop, when we run the pipeline once again you will have 3 rows resulting because the the null values will be omitted.","title":" JSON Input","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"jsoninput","url":"/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/jsoninput.html","titles":[{"text":"Description","hash":"_description","id":1},{"text":"TIPS","hash":"_tips","id":2},{"text":"Examples","hash":"_examples","id":3},{"text":"Supported Engines","hash":"_supported_engines","id":4},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":5},{"text":"File Tab","hash":"_file_tab","id":6},{"text":"Content Tab","hash":"_content_tab","id":7},{"text":"Fields Tab","hash":"_fields_tab","id":8},{"text":"Additional output fields tab","hash":"_additional_output_fields_tab","id":9},{"text":"Considerations","hash":"_considerations","id":10}]},"280":{"id":280,"text":"The JSON Output transform allows you to generate JSON blocks based on input transform values.

It runs a sub-pipeline that executes according to message batch size or duration, letting you process a continuous stream of records in near-real-time. This sub-pipeline must start with an Injector transform. You can define the number of messages to accept for processing, as well as the specific data formats to stream activity data and system metrics. You can set up this transform to collect monitored events, track user consumption of data streams, and monitor alerts. Kafka records are stored within topics, and consist of a category to which the records are published. Topics are divided into a set of logs known as partitions. Kafka scales topic consumption by distributing partitions among a consumer group. A consumer group is a set of consumers sharing a common group identifier. Since the Kafka Consumer transform continuously ingests streaming data, you may want to use the Abort transform in your parent or sub-pipeline to stop consuming records from Kafka for specific workflows. For example, you can run the parent pipeline on a timed schedule, or abort the sub-pipeline if sensor data exceeds a preset range. Hop Engine Spark Flink Dataflow Option Description Transform name The name for this transform Kafka pipeline Specify the pipeline to execute by entering its path or clicking Browse and selecting the path. Note: this pipeline must start with an Injector transform. Option Description Bootstrap servers Comma separated list of bootstrap servers in a Kafka cluster Topics Enter the name of each Kafka topic from which you want to consume streaming data (messages). Consumer group Enter the name of the group of which you want this consumer to be a member. Each Kafka Consumer transform will start a single thread for consuming. If left empty, it will be defaulted to Apache Hop. When part of a consumer group, each consumer is assigned a subset of the partitions from topics it has subscribed to, which locks those partitions. Each instance of a Kafka Consumer transform will only run a single consumer thread. Use this tab to determine how many messages to consume before processing. You can specify message count and/or a specific amount of time. While either option will trigger consumption, the first satisfied option will start the pipeline for the batch. Option Description Duration (ms) Specify a time in milliseconds. This value is the amount of time the transform will spend collecting records prior to the execution of the pipeline. If set to a value of ‘0’, then Number of records triggers consumption. Number of records Specify a number. After every ‘X’ number of records, the specified pipeline will be executed and these ‘X’ records will be passed to the pipeline. If set to a value of ‘0’ then Duration triggers consumption. Offset management Choose when to commit when record read when batch completed Option Description Input name The input name is received from the Kafka streams. The following are received by default: key: Determines message distribution to partitions. If no key is present, messages are randomly distributed from partitions. message: The individual message contained in a record. Each record consists of a key, a value, and a timestamp. topic: The category to which records are published. partition: An ordered sequence of records that is continuously appended. You cannot have more consumers than the number of partitions. offset: A sequential ID number assigned by Kafka to each record. It uniquely identifies each record within the partition. timestamp: The time the message is received on the server. Output name The Output name can be mapped to subscriber and member requirements. Type The Type field defines the data format for streaming the record. You must choose the same data type that produced the records. This field applies to the ‘key’ and ‘message’ input names. Options include: String Boolean Number Integer Binary Return fields from a transform in the sub pipeline for further processing in this pipeline. Use this tab to configure the property formats of the Kafka consumer broker sources. A few of the most common property formats have been included for your convenience. You can enter any desired Kafka property. For further information on these input names, see the Apache Kafka documentation site: https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/. The options that are included by default are: NName Value auto.offset.reset latest ssl.key.password ssl.keystore.location ssl.keystore.password ssl.truststore.location ssl.truststore.password The Kafka consumer supports error handling but this is limited to the case of Batch Size equal to 1 (records from the Kafka queue are processed one by one). In this case, whenever a record coming from the Kafka queue generates an error in the called sub pipeline, that record will be sent along to the error path for further processing. The record that enter the error path is committed in Kafka and next records in the queue can be processed without any problem. Apart the errors fields inserted by error handling, the layout of the record flowing into the error path will be the layout specified in Field tab. This feature is very useful in any case where we have a record in the Kafka queue that is stopping processing of further records (because it generates an error during processing) and we want to \"remove it\" from the queue so that we can process the remaining records in the queue. The failing record can be saved somewhere (for example saved to a file or to a DB table) for further investigation. Here are some options you need to consume Avro Record values from a Kafka server.

Hop Engine Spark Flink Dataflow This transform is useful for comparing data collected at two different times. For example, the source system of your data warehouse might not contain a timestamp of the last data update. You could use this transform to compare the two data streams and merge the dates and timestamps in the rows. Based on key fields and comparison fields, this transform merges reference rows with compare rows and creates merged output rows. A flag in each row indicates how the values were compared and merged. The possible flag values are: identical: The key was found in both rows, and the compared values are identical. changed: The key was found in both rows, but one or more compared values are different. new: The key was not found in the reference rows. deleted: The key was not found in the compare rows. If the row’s flag is identical or deleted, the merged output row is based on the reference row. If the flag is new or changed, the merged output row is based on the compare row. You can also send the merged and flagged rows to a subsequent transform in your pipeline, such as Switch-Case or Synchronize after merge. In the subsequent transform, you can use the flag field generated by Merge rows (diff) to control updates/inserts/deletes on a target table. Option Description Transform name Name of the transform.

This can significantly reduce the need to develop slightly different versions of what is basically the same pipeline. Hop Engine Spark Flink Dataflow The Metadata Injection transform (MDI transform) inserts data and transform properties into a pipeline that is dynamically configured at runtime. This is typically used to enhance reusability of a pipeline. E.g. Use Case: If you have 10 different CSV file definitions and don’t want to create 10 pipelines for each separate file, you can use ETL metadata injection. After the MDI transform is configured (mapping data and properties to the template/target pipeline), at run-time it will dynamically populate any non configured transform properties in the target pipeline. For example, in the template file, if you leave the Table input Database fields empty, and if configured in the MDI transform, it will populate the Table field and Stream fields dynamically. Basically, the ETL Metadata Injection transform overrules the default behavior for the named pipeline. Not all incoming streams need to have the same layout. It is perfectly OK to provide input to the metadata injection transform from different streams with different layouts. Sample files: Configure MDI: read-and-inject-metadata.hpl Read and fill in Template: read-file-template.hpl Read more on metadata injection Option Description Transform name Name of the transform. Pipeline Specify your template pipeline by entering in its path. Click Browse to display and enter the path details using the Virtual File System Browser. If you select a pipeline that has the same root path as the current pipeline, the variable ${Internal.Transform.Current.Directory} will automatically be inserted in place of the common root path. For example, if the current pipeline’s path is /home/admin/pipeline.hpl and you select a pipeline in the folder /home/admin/path/sub.hpl then the path will automatically be converted to ${Internal.Transform.Current.Directory}/path/sub.hpl. The ETL Metadata Injection transform features the two tabs with fields. Each tab is described below. This tab shows transforms and properties on the target/template file that will be modified at run-time. Map each property to a source that you would like to be populated dynamically. Option Description Target injection transform key Lists the available fields in each transform of the template pipeline that can be injected with metadata. Target description Describes how the target fields relate to their target transforms. Source transform Lists the transform associated with the fields to be injected into the target fields as metadata. Source field Lists the fields to be injected into the target fields as metadata. To specify the source field as metadata to be injected, perform the following transforms: In the Target injection transform key column, double-click the field for which you want to specify a source field. The Source field dialog box opens. Select a source field and click OK. Optionally, select Use constant value to specify a constant value for the injected metadata through one of the following actions: Manually entering a value. Using an internal variable to set the value (${Internal.transform.Unique.Count} for example). Using a combination of manually specified values and parameter values (${FILE_PREFIX}_${FILE_DATE}.txt for example). When specifying constant values for grouped lists of values like fields or filenames please note that there isn’t a good solution for that. Best practice is to use a Data Grid transform to inject a complete set of constant values. You can map those in this metadata injection transform. It will do its best to accommodate you by allowing you to inject a single row in the group with the specified constant value. For injecting metadata into the ETL Metadata Injection transform itself, the following exceptions apply: To inject a method for how to specify a field (such as by FILENAME), set a PIPELINE_SPECIFICATION_METHOD constant to the field of an input transform. You can then map the field as a source to the PIPELINE_SPECIFICATION_METHOD constant in the ETL Metadata Injection transform. The target field for the ETL Metadata Injection transform inserting the metadata into the original injection is defined by [GROUP NAME].[FIELD NAME]. For example, if the GROUP NAME is 'OUTPUT_FIELDS' and the FIELD NAME is 'OUTPUT_FIELDNAME', you would set the target field to 'OUTPUT_FIELDS.OUTPUT_FIELDNAME'. Option Description transform to read from (optional) Optionally, select a transform in your template pipeline to pass data directly to a transform following the ETL Metadata Injection transform in your current pipeline. Field name If transform to read from is selected, enter the name of the field passed directly from the transform in the template pipeline. Type If transform to read from is selected, select the type of the field passed directly from the transform in the template pipeline. Length If transform to read from is selected, enter the length of the field passed directly from the transform in the template pipeline. Precision If transform to read from is selected, enter the precision of the field passed directly from the transform in the template pipeline. Optional target file (hpl after injection) For initial pipeline development or debugging, specify an optional file for creating and saving a pipeline of your template after metadata injection occurs. The resulting pipeline will be your template pipeline with the metadata already injected as constant values. Streaming source transform Select a source transform in your current pipeline to directly pass data to the Streaming target transform in the template pipeline. Streaming target transform Select the target transform in your template pipeline to receive data directly from the Streaming source transform. Run resulting pipeline Select to inject metadata and run the template pipeline. If this option is not selected, metadata injection occurs, but the template pipeline does not run. Troubleshooting Enter a pipeline filename in \"Optional target file (hpl after injection)\" so that a file will be generated after injection. This pipeline will contain all the properties after injection and can be viewed and executed for testing.","title":" Metadata Injection","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"metainject","url":"/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/metainject.html","titles":[{"text":"Description","hash":"_description","id":1},{"text":"Supported Engines","hash":"_supported_engines","id":2},{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage","id":3},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":4},{"text":"General","hash":"_general","id":5},{"text":"Inject Metadata Tab","hash":"_inject_metadata_tab","id":6},{"text":"Injecting Metadata into the ETL Metadata Injection transform","hash":"_injecting_metadata_into_the_etl_metadata_injection_transform","id":7},{"text":"Options Tab","hash":"_options_tab","id":8}]},"294":{"id":294,"text":"The Metadata Structure Of Stream transform produces the metadata structure of the input fields of this transform as output.

Name The name of the field based on the value in the Path field. The name that appears here maps the name of the field as it appears in the pipeline with the field that appears in the MongoDB database. You can edit the name. Path Indicates the JSON path of the field in MongoDB. If the path shown is an array, you can specify a specific element of the array by passing it the key value in the bracketed part of the array. For example: $.emails[0] indicates that you want the result to display the first value in the array. To display all array values, use the asterisk as the key, like this $.email[*]. If the array contains records, and not just strings, you can specify that you want to display the record like this: $.emails[].sender. Type Indicates the data type. Indexed values Specify a comma-separated list of legal values for String fields. When you specify values in this field, the Hop indexed data type is applied to the data. If no values are specified, the String data type is applied. Usually, you will only need to modify this field if you are using Weka metadata for nominal fields. Sample: array min: max index Indicates minimum and maximum values for the index in the sampled documents. Sample: #occur/#docs Indicates how often the field occurs and the number of documents processed. Sample: disparate types Indicates if different data types populate the same field in the sampled documents. When several documents are sampled and the same field contain different data types, the Sample: disparate types field is populated with a Y and the Type field displays the String data type. The Hop type for the field is set to the String data type, for different output value types. The following sections contain examples of query expressions and aggregate pipelines. MongoDB allows you to select and filter documents in a collection using specific fields and values. The MongoDB Extended JSON documentation details how to use queries. Apache Hop supports only the features discussed on this page. The following table displays some examples of the syntax and structure of the queries you can use to request data from MongoDB: Query expression Description { name : \"MongoDB\" } Queries all values where the name field has a value equal to MongoDB. { name : { '$regex' : \"m.*\", '$options' : \"i\" } } Uses a regular expression to find name fields starting with m, case insensitive. { name : { '$gt' : \"M\" } } Searches all strings greater than M. { name : { '$lte' : \"T\" } } Searches all strings less than or equal to T. { name : { '$in' : [ \"MongoDB\", \"MySQL\" ] } } Finds all names that are either MongoDB or MySQL (Reference). { name : { '$nin' : [ \"MongoDB\", \"MySQL\" ] } } Finds all names that are not either MongoDB or MySQL, or where the field is not set . { created_at : { $gte : { $date : \"2014-12-31T00:00:00.000Z\" } } } Finds all created_at documents that are greater than or equal to the specified UTC date. { $where : \"this.count == 1\" } Uses JavaScript to evaluate a condition. { $query: {}, $orderby: { age : -1 } } Returns all documents in the collection named collection sorted by the age field in descending order. MongoDB allows you to select and filter documents using the aggregation pipeline framework. The Aggregation page in the MongoDB documentation provides additional examples of function calls. The following table displays some examples of the query syntax and structure you can use to request data from MongoDB: Query expression Description { $match : {state : \"FL\", city : \"ORLANDO\" } }, {$sort : {pop : -1 } } Returns all fields from all documents where the state field has a value of FL and the city field has a value of ORLANDO. The returned documents will be sorted by the pop field in descending order. { $group : { _id: \"$state\"} }, { $sort : { _id : 1 } } Returns one field named _id containing the distinct values for state in ascending order. This is similar to the SQL statement SELECT DISTINCT state AS _id FROM collection ORDER BY state ASC. { $match : {state : \"FL\" } }, { $group: {_id: \"$city\" , pop: { $sum: \"$pop\" } } }, { $sort: { pop: -1 } }, { $project: {_id : 0, city : \"$_id\" } } Returns all documents where the state field has a value of FL, aggregates all values of pop for each city, sorts by population descending, and returns one field named city. { $unwind : \"$result\" } Peels off the elements of an array individually, and returns one document for each element of the array.","title":" MongoDB Input","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"mongodbinput","url":"/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/mongodbinput.html","titles":[{"text":"Description","hash":"_description","id":1},{"text":"Supported Engines","hash":"_supported_engines","id":2},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":3},{"text":"General","hash":"_general","id":4},{"text":"Input options tab","hash":"_input_options_tab","id":5},{"text":"Query tab","hash":"_query_tab","id":6},{"text":"Fields tab","hash":"_fields_tab","id":7},{"text":"Examples","hash":"_examples","id":8},{"text":"Query expression","hash":"_query_expression","id":9},{"text":"Aggregate pipeline","hash":"_aggregate_pipeline","id":10}]},"298":{"id":298,"text":"The MongoDB Output transform can output data to a MongoDB database collection.

Mongo document path The hierarchical path to fields in a document in dot notation format. Use field name Whether to use the incoming field name as the final entry in the path. The values are Y (use incoming field names) and N (do not use incoming field names). When set to Y, a preceding period (.) is assumed. NULL values Specifies whether to insert null values in the database. The values are: - Insert NULL - Ignore JSON Indicates the incoming value is a JSON document. Match field for update Indicates whether to match a field when performing an upsert operation. The first document in the collection that matches all fields tagged as Y in this column is replaced with the new document constructed with incoming values for all the defined field paths. If a matching document does not exist, then a new document is inserted into the collection. Modifier operation Specify in-place modifications of existing document fields. The modifiers are: - N/A - $set : Sets the value of a field. - $inc : Sets the value of a field if the field does not exist. If the field exists, increases (or decreases, with a negative value) the value of a field. - $push : Sets the value of a field if the field does not exist. If the field exists, appends the value of a field. - $ : (the positional operator for matching inside of arrays). Modifier policy Controls when execution of a modifier operation affects a field. The values are: - Insert&Update : The operation is executed whether or not a match exists in the collection (default). The Insert&Update modifier policy (upsert) allows you to specify fields to match when performing an upsert operation. Upsert only replaces the first matching document. Modifier upserts can be used to replace certain field values in multiple documents. - Insert : The operation is executed on an insert only (when the match conditions fail) - Update : The operation is executed when match conditions succeed. Here is an example of how you can define a document structure with an arbitrary hierarchy. Use the following input data and document field definitions to create the example document structure in MongoDB: first, last, address, age Bob, Jones ,\"13 Bob Street\", 34 Fred, Flintstone, \"10 Rock Street\",50 Zaphod, Beeblebrox, \"Beetlejuice 1\", 356 Noddy,Puppet,\"Noddy Land\",5 Name Mongo document path Use field name NULL values JSON Match field for update Modifier operation Modifier policy first top1 Y N N N/A Insert&Update last array[O] Y N N N/A Insert&Update address array[O] Y N N N/A Insert&Update age array[O] Y N N N/A Insert&Update { \"top1\" : { \"first\" : \"\" }, \"array\" : [ { \"last\" : \"\" , \"address\" : \"\"}], \"age\" : \"\" } Use the Create/drop indexes tab to create and drop indexes on one or more fields.

Parameters can be specified in the next section of the options. Use UNWIND to collect parameter values? This option collects all the parameters in a map, adds all the row maps together in a list and passes this to the UNWIND statement. Consider this example: UNWIND $customers AS customer CREATE (c:Customer { id : customer.id, name : customer.name }) we pick up customer.id and customer.name as parameters. The customers parameter comes from the name of the unwind map. Name of UNWIND values map the name of the map containing all the rows and values for the UNWIND statement. Parameters You can pick any Neo4j approved parameter name (without spaces and so on), the field to use and the Neo4j data type to convert to. Returns this transform can return one or more rows of data. You can specify the return values here. For every input row you can then have 0, 1 or more output rows. If you do not specify any return values the output will simply be the same as the input.","title":" Neo4j Cypher","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"neo4j-cypher","url":"/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/neo4j-cypher.html","titles":[{"text":"Description","hash":"_description","id":1},{"text":"Supported Engines","hash":"_supported_engines","id":2},{"text":"Notable options","hash":"_notable_options","id":3}]},"301":{"id":301,"text":"The Neo4j Generate CSV transform writes files for nodes and relationships to the import folder for use with Neo4j’s neo4j-import tool.

Field to relationship mappings tab Sometimes you want to select a relationship in your graph model based on input data. Here are the 4 different types of relationship mappings you can apply to steer this behavior: * No mapping : the line is ignored * Do not update relationships between specified nodes: you can specify the source and target node labels between you don’t want to update any relationships * Update specific relationship using field value: You can specify the field to look at and the value to consider for the relationship you want to select. * Update all relationships between the specified nodes (Default): all the relationships between the specified source and target node, as defined in the graph model are updated (merged and properties updated). Node label mappings tab In case you want to select specific labels from the ones specified in the graph model you can create mapping entries in this tab. Here are the node mapping types: * Select all defined labels (default): when matching/merging nodes all the labels from the graph model are selected. * Use a field value to select a specific label: for the specified node we look at the input field you like and if it matches the value the label is selected to match/merge on. * Add the specified label if a field contains a specific value: for the node that is selected, set the selected label if a field contains a specific value. * Select the first label: for the specified node we only use the first label from the graph model to match/merge on.","title":" Neo4j Graph Output","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"neo4j-graphoutput","url":"/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/neo4j-graphoutput.html","titles":[{"text":"Description","hash":"_description","id":1},{"text":"Supported Engines","hash":"_supported_engines","id":2},{"text":"Limitations","hash":"_limitations","id":3},{"text":"Modeling tips","hash":"_modeling_tips","id":4},{"text":"Execution tips","hash":"_execution_tips","id":5},{"text":"Notable options","hash":"_notable_options","id":6}]},"304":{"id":304,"text":"The Neo4j Import transform runs an import command using the provided CSV files.

High IO true Ignore environment-based heuristics, and specify whether the target storage subsystem can support parallel IO with high throughput. Typically this is true for SSDs, large raid arrays and network-attached storage. Cache on heap? false Determines whether or not to allow allocating memory for the cache on heap. If false, then caches will still be allocated off-heap, but the additional free memory inside the JVM will not be allocated for the caches. Use this to have better control over the heap memory. Ignore Empty Strings false Determines whether or not empty string fields, such as \"\", from input source are ignored (treated as null). Ignore extra columns? false If unspecified columns should be ignored during the import. Legacy style quoting? false Determines whether or not backslash-escaped quote e.g. \\\" is interpreted as inner quote. Fields can have multi-line data? false Determines whether or not fields from input source can span multiple lines, i.e. contain newline characters. Setting --multiline-fields=true can severely degrade performance of the importer. Therefore, use it with care, especially with large imports. Normalize types? false Determines whether or not to normalize property types to Cypher types, e.g. int becomes long and float becomes double. Skip logging bad entries during import? Determines whether or not to skip logging bad entries detected during import. Skip bad relationships? false Determines whether or not to skip importing relationships that refer to missing node IDs, i.e. either start or end node ID/group referring to node that was not specified by the node input data. Skipped relationships will be logged, containing at most the number of entities specified by --bad-tolerance, unless otherwise specified by the --skip-bad-entries-logging option. Skip duplicate nodes? false Determines whether or not to skip importing nodes that have the same ID/group. In the event of multiple nodes within the same group having the same ID, the first encountered will be imported, whereas consecutive such nodes will be skipped. Skipped nodes will be logged, containing at most the number of entities specified by --bad-tolerance, unless otherwise specified by the --skip-bad-entries-logging option. Trim strings? false Determines whether or not strings should be trimmed for whitespaces. Bad tolerance 1000 Number of bad entries before the import is considered failed. This tolerance threshold is about relationships referring to missing nodes. Format errors in input data are still treated as errors. Max memory false Maximum memory that neo4j-admin can use for various data structures and caching to improve performance. Values can be plain numbers such as 10000000, or 20G for 20 gigabyte. It can also be specified as a percentage of the available memory, for example 70%. Read buffer size 4M Size of each buffer for reading input data. It has to at least be large enough to hold the biggest single value in the input data. Value can be a plain number or byte units string, e.g. 128k, 1m. Processors 90% Max number of processors used by the importer. Defaults to the number of available processors reported by the JVM.

It is similar to the Workflow Executor transform, but works with pipelines. Hop Engine Spark Flink Dataflow The pipeline executor transform by default sends rows to the child pipeline one by one. This default behavior can be changed in the \"Row grouping\" tab. Optionally, you can use a \"Get rows from result\" transform in a pipeline to fetch the previous rows from a sub pipeline. You do not need to define any fields in the Get rows transform to retrieve all data row fields. You can either run the same pipeline for each row by specifying a pipeline name to execute, or accept a pipeline name from an incoming field (from a table for example). You can launch multiple copies of the transform to run in parallel. Parameters: Can map sub pipeline parameters to fields in your current pipeline. If you enable the \"Inherit all variables from pipeline\" option, all the parameters/variables defined in the parent pipeline are passed to the pipeline. However, only the parameters defined on the Parameters tab are set per data input row to the pipeline. Output hop connector options: If you select the incorrect output option for the pipeline executor, it may not return the data expected. This output will contain the execution results: Returns stats on the execution and does not limit fields, variables, or parameters in the output. It’s a good idea to at least check if there have been any issues in one of your child pipelines with the ExecutionResult, ExecutionExitStatus or ExecutionNrErrors fields. This output will contain the result rows after execution: Outputs a rowset that was copied to memory by the child pipeline, e.g. with a Copy rows to result transform. Use the \"Result rows\" tab in the pipeline executor transform to specify which fields you expect to receive from the child pipelines. This option is also required for setting variables downstream and working with the variables upstream if valid in the your scope. The output will contain result file names after execution: Outputs a rowset that will contain any filenames that were copied to the results, e.g. with the Add filenames to result in the Content tab of the Text file input^ transform. The output will contain a copy of the executor transform’s input data: Outputs the rowset as it was received by the pipeline executor transform. Main output of transform: Outputs a rowset that mimics the input for the pipeline executor transform. Depending on your requirements, the Pipeline Executor transform can be configured to function in any of the following ways: By default, the specified pipeline will be executed once for each input row. You can use the input row to set parameters and variables. The executor transform then passes this row to the pipeline in the form of a result row. You can also pass a group of records based on the value in a field, so that when the field value changes dynamically, the specified pipeline is executed. In these cases, the first row in the group of rows is used to set parameters or variables in the pipeline. You can launch multiple copies of this transform to assist in parallel pipeline processing. See also: The Workflow action that executes a sub-workflow from a workflow. The Pipeline action that executes a pipeline from a workflow. The Workflow Executor transform that executes a workflow from a pipeline. The Loops in Apache Hop how-to guide. Samples (samples project): loops/pipeline-executor.hpl Option Description Transform name Name of the transform. Pipeline Use this section to specify the pipeline to execute. You have the following options to specify the pipeline: Use a file for the pipeline: when this option is enabled, you can enter the the .hpl file that is to be used as pipeline. The filename may contain variables (for example, you can use the built-in Internal.Pipeline.Filename.Directory variable to construct a filename relative to the current pipeline), or you can use the \"Browse\" button to select a file using a file browser. Pipeline from field? Enable to specify the pipeline file name(s) in a field in the input stream Pipeline field When the previous option is enabled, you can specify the field that will contain the pipeline filename(s) at runtime. The filename may contain variables. NOTE: It must be considered that, by specifying the pipeline file name using this option, we can experience a little performance penalty because the pipeline that will be executed will be initialized at runtime and not during the initialization phase as usual. On the other side this option gives greater flexibility in specifying the pipeline filename dynamically and this could be useful for many use-cases. In this tab you can specify which field to use to set a certain parameter or variable value. If multiple rows are passed to the workflow, the first row is taken to set the parameters or variables. TIP: If you leave the \"Inherit all variables from pipeline\" option checked (it is by default), all the variables defined in the current pipeline are passed to the child pipeline. You can pass parameters and variables downstream only. You can’t pass params/variables between pipelines unless they are started new. For example, you can pass params/variables between pipelines, when each named pipeline is started in a pipeline executor – once per row. Though you cannot pass parameters and variables upstream (in nested or sequential pipelines) you can pass data rows back up a pipeline via the following pattern. See project: samples/loops/pipeline-executor.hpl The parent pipeline executor specifies the row field name defined in the child pipeline row under the tab “Result rows”. The output of the parent pipeline executor is option “result rows after execution”. Child pipeline: A data row is generated with the same field name and type that is defined in the parent pipeline executor tab “Results rows” in the child pipeline. The last transform of the child pipeline is “copy rows to result”. Remember that all parameters must be defined (in edit pipeline/workflow properties) at least once in each pipeline or workflow. Option Description Variable / Parameter name The Parameters tab allows you to define or pass Hop variables down to the pipeline. Field to use Specify which field to use to set a certain parameter or variable value. If you specify an input field to use, the static input value is not used. Static input value Instead of a field to use you can specify a static value here. The Get Parameters button in the lower right corner of the tab that will insert all the defined parameters with their description for the specified pipeline. The Map Parameters button in the lower right corner of the tab lets you map fields in the current pipeline to parameters in the child pipeline. On this tab you can specify the amount of input rows that are passed to the pipeline in the form of result rows. You can use the result rows in a Get rows from result transform in a pipeline. Option Description The number of rows to send to the pipeline after every X rows the pipeline will be executed and these X rows will be passed to the pipeline Field to group rows on Rows will be accumulated in a group as long as the field value stays the same.

Hop Engine Spark Flink Dataflow For example, if you have an input field containing an author’s name in quotes and the number of posts made by them, you can create two new fields in your pipeline - one for the name, and one for the number of posts as shown below: Text to parse: \"Author, Ann\" - 53 posts Regex to create two capture groups: ^\"([^\"]*)\" - (\\d*) posts$ The resulting field values are: Ann and 53.

Result field name Specify the name of the output field. This field is added to the outgoing Hop stream and has a value of Y to indicate the value of the input field matched the regular expression or N to indicate it did not match. Create fields for capture groups Select to create new fields based on capture groups, in the regular expression. When this option is selected, substrings in the captured groups are extracted and stored in new output fields, that you specify in the Capture Group Fields table. Each capture group must have a field defined in the Capture Group Fields table. The order of the fields in the table must be the same as the order of the capturing groups in the regular expression. You can change the data type using the columns in the table. Replace previous fields Select to replace fields from the incoming Hop stream with fields created for the capture group field names, if the fields have the same name. If this option is clear, new fields are added to the outgoing Hop stream for each capturing group field. This option is available when you select the Create fields for capture groups option. Regular expression Specify your regular expression. Click Test regEx to open the Regular expression evaluation window. Use variable substitution Select to expand variable references to their values before evaluating the regular expression pattern. You can test your regular expression against three different input strings using the following Regular expression evaluation window.

Only characters in the US-ASCII charset are matched. Unicode-aware case-insensitive matching can be enabled by specifying the 'Unicode-aware case…​' flag in conjunction with this flag. The execution flag is (?i). Permit whitespace and comments in pattern Select to ignore whitespace and embedded comments starting with # through the end of the line. In this mode, you must use the \\s token to match whitespace. If this option is not enabled, whitespace characters appearing in the regular expression are matched as-is. The execution flag is (?x). Enable dotall mode Select to include line terminators with the dot character expression match. The execution flag is (?s). Enable multiline mode Select to match the start of a line '^' or the end of a line '$' of the input sequence. By default, these expressions only match at the beginning and the end of the entire input sequence. The execution flag is(?m) Enable Unicode-aware case folding Select this option in conjunction with the Enables case-insensitive matching option to perform case-insensitive matching consistent with the Unicode standard. The execution flag is (?u). Enables Unix lines mode Select to only recognize the line terminator in the behavior of '.', '^', and '$'.\\ The execution flag is (?d). Suppose your input field contains a text value like \"Author, Ann\" - 53 posts. The following regular expression creates four capturing groups and can be used to parse out the different parts: ^\"(([\"]), ([\"]))\" - (\\d+) posts\\.$ This expression creates the following four capturing groups, which become output fields: Fullname: [\"]), ([\"] Lastname: ([^\"]+) Firstname: ([^\"]+) Number of posts: (\\d+) In this example, a field definition must be present for each of these capturing groups. If the number of capture groups in the regular expression does not match the number of fields specified, the transform will fail and an error is written to the log. Capturing groups can be nested. In the example above the fields Lastname and Firstname correspond to the capturing groups that are themselves contained inside the Fullname capturing group.","title":" Regex Evaluation","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"regexeval","url":"/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/regexeval.html","titles":[{"text":"Description","hash":"_description","id":1},{"text":"Supported Engines","hash":"_supported_engines","id":2},{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage","id":3},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":4},{"text":"General","hash":"_general","id":5},{"text":"Capture Group Fields","hash":"_capture_group_fields","id":6},{"text":"Settings Tab","hash":"_settings_tab","id":7},{"text":"Test regEx","hash":"_test_regex","id":8},{"text":"Content Tab","hash":"_content_tab","id":9},{"text":"Examples","hash":"_examples","id":10}]},"323":{"id":323,"text":"The Replace In String transform performs simple search and replace operations on String fields.

It is important to isolate a single row for this transform, a simple way to do this is using the Blocking transform Variables have no type in Hop (casted as strings). If working with formulas for example, it may not have a type so be sure to convert to string if necessary (can use the TEXT function). Variables set with Set Variable are not available to use in the current pipeline. If set values are needed in the current pipeline the values will have to come from fields. Note that variables cannot be passed upstream between pipelines. Parameters are best passed downstream to avoid threading issues. A nested pipeline is technically the same pipeline, so variables are inherited in the initialization phase. Though you cannot pass parameters and variables upstream (in nested or sequential pipelines) you can pass data rows back up a pipeline via the following pattern in the samples project: samples/loops/pipeline-executor.hpl A variable can be set in one pipeline and be available in the next pipeline (named pipeline) that is in the loop of a pipeline executor. If you are using a pipeline executor child, the parent pipeline does not restart and does not get any set variables. The new variable name to set in a child pipeline is shown below in the second column. This transform accepts one (and only one) row of data to set the value of a variable. If you want to set a variable from a pipeline that processes multiple lines of data, make sure you isolate a single row before setting a variable. You can’t set and use a variable in the same pipeline. Since all transforms in a pipeline run in parallel, there is no way a transform in a pipeline can use a variable that is set in another transform in that same pipeline.

If we mistakenly leave the Header flag set on files that do not have any columns' names in its first row, Hop will set the column’s name the value found on a specific column for its specific position. In case, for that specific position, the column’s value is empty, Hop will set column’s name to EmptyField_ where n is the position of the column in the columns' set. NOTE: remember also to perform a check on the guessed data types and column’s specifier that was set after the file’s analysis because they could be wrong due to wrong assumptions made by Hop while looking at the sample dataset. Wrapped lines and number of wraps Use if you deal with data lines that have wrapped beyond a specific page limit; note that headers and footers are never considered wrapped Paged layout and page size and doc header Use these options as a last resort when dealing with texts meant for printing on a line printer; use the number of document header lines to skip introductory texts and the number of lines per page to position the data lines Compression Enable if your text file is placed in a Zip or GZip archive.Note: At the moment, only the first file in the archive is read. No empty rows Do not send empty rows to the next transforms. Include filename in output Enable if you want the filename to be part of the output Filename field name Name of the field that contains the filename Rownum in output? Enable if you want the row number to be part of the output Row number field name Name of the field that contains the row number Rownum by file? Allows the row number to be reset per file Format Can be either DOS, UNIX or mixed. UNIX files have lines that are terminated by line feeds. DOS files have lines separated by carriage returns and line feeds. If you specify mixed, no verification is done. Encoding Specify the text file encoding to use; leave blank to use the default encoding on your system. To use Unicode, specify UTF-8 or UTF-16. On first use, Hop searches your system for available encodings. Limit Sets the number of lines that is read from the file; 0 means read all lines. Be lenient when parsing dates? Disable if you want strict parsing of data fields; if case-lenient parsing is enabled, dates like Jan 32nd will become Feb 1st. The date format Locale This locale is used to parse dates that have been written in full such as \"February 2nd, 2006;\" parsing this date on a system running in the French (fr_FR) locale would not work because February is called Février in that locale. Add filenames to result Adds the filenames to the internal filename result set. This internal result set can be used later on, e.g. to process all read files. The error handling tab allows you to specify how the transform reacts when errors occur. The table below describes the options available for Error handling: Option Description Ignore errors? Enable if you want to ignore errors during parsing Skip error lines Enable if you want to skip those lines that contain errors. You can generate an extra file that contains the line numbers on which the errors occurred. Lines with errors are not skipped, the fields that have parsing errors, will be empty (null) Error count field name Add a field to the output stream rows; this field contains the number of errors on the line Error fields field name Add a field to the output stream rows; this field contains the field names on which an error occurred Error text field name Add a field to the output stream rows; this field contains the descriptions of the parsing errors that have occurred Warnings file directory When warnings are generated, they are placed in this directory. The name of that file is /filename.. Error files directory When errors occur related to non-existing or non-accessible files, they are placed in this directory. The name of the file is /filename.. Failing line numbers files directory When a parsing error occurs on a line, the line number is placed in this directory. The name of that file is /filename.. The filters tab provides you with the ability to specify the lines you want to skip in the text file. The table below describes the available options for defining filters: Option Description Filter string The string for which to search Filter position The position where the filter string has to be at in the line. Zero (0) is the first position in the line. If you specify a value below zero (0) here, the filter string is searched for in the entire string. Stop on filter Specify Y here if you want to stop processing the current text file when the filter string is encountered. Positive match Specify Y here if you want to process lines that match the filter, or N if you want to ignore such lines. The fields tab allows you to specify the information about the name and format of the fields being read from the text file. You can choose to use a Schema Definition or to define the required fields' layout manually. Available options include: Option Description Schema Definition Name of the Schema Definition that we want to reference. Name Name of the field Type Type of the field can be either String, Date or Number Format See Number Formats for a complete description of format symbols. Position This is needed when processing the 'Fixed' filetype. It is zero based, so the first character is starting with position 0. Length For Number: Total number of significant figures in a number; For String: total length of string; For Date: length of printed output of the string (e.g. 4 only gives back the year). Precision For Number: Number of floating point digits; For String, Date, Boolean: unused; Currency Used to interpret numbers like $10,000.00 or E5.000,00 Decimal A decimal point can be a \".\" (10;000.00) or \",\" (5.000,00) Grouping A grouping can be a dot \",\" (10;000.00) or \".\" (5.000,00) Null if Treat this value as NULL Default Default value in case the field in the text file was not specified (empty) Trim type trim this field (left, right, both) before processing Repeat If the corresponding value in this row is empty, repeat the one from the last row when it was not empty. Number Formats The information below on Number formats was taken from the Sun Java API documentation, located at http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html. For further information on valid numeric formats used in this transform, view the Number Formatting Table. Symbol Location Localized Meaning 0 Number Yes Digit # Number Yes Digit, zero shows as absent . Number Yes Decimal separator or monetary decimal separator - Number Yes Minus sign , Number Yes Grouping separator E Number Yes Separates mantissa and exponent in scientific notation; need not be quoted in prefix or suffix ; Sub pattern boundary Yes Separates positive and negative sub patterns % Prefix or suffix Yes Multiply by 100 and show as percentage \\u2030 Prefix or suffix Yes Multiply by 1000 and show as per mille € (\\u00A4) Prefix or suffix No Currency sign, replaced by currency symbol. If doubled, replaced by international currency symbol. If present in a pattern, the monetary decimal separator is used instead of the decimal separator. ' Prefix or suffix No Used to quote special characters in a prefix or suffix, for example, \"''\" formats 123 to \"123\". To create a single quote itself, use two in a row: \" o''clock\". Scientific Notation In a pattern, the exponent character immediately followed by one or more digit characters indicates scientific notation (for example, \"0.###E0\" formats the number 1234 as \"1.234E3\".

Root uri field The field name that contains only the root part of the URI. Function/Button Description Show filenames Displays a list of all the files selected. Note that if the pipeline is to be run on a separate server, the result might be incorrect. Show file content Displays the first lines of the text-file. Make sure that the file-format is correct. When in doubt, try both DOS and UNIX formats. Show content from first data line Helps you position the data lines in complex text files with multiple header lines and more. Get fields Allows you to guess the layout of the file. In case of a CSV file, this is performed almost automatically.

This is commonly used to generate Comma Separated Values (CSV files) that can be read by spreadsheet applications. It is also possible to generate fixed width files by setting lengths on the fields in the fields tab. You can choose to use a Schema Definition or to define the required fields' layout manually. If you decide to define the fields layout by using a Schema Definition, use the Schema Mapping transform to adjust the incoming stream according to the choosen Schema Definition Hop Engine Spark Flink Dataflow The File tab is where you define basic properties about the file being created, such as: Option Description Transform Name Name of the transform this name has to be unique in a single pipeline. Filename This field specifies the filename and location of the output text file. Run this as a command instead? Enable to \"pipe\" the results into the command or script you specify. It can also be used for some database bulk loaders that can process the input from stdin. In this case set the filename to the script or binary to execute. Pass output to servlet Enable this option to return the data via a web service instead writing into a file Create parent folder Enable to create the parent folder Do not create file at start Enable to avoid empty files when no rows are getting processed. Accept file name from field? Enable to specify the file name(s) in a field in the input stream File name field When the previous option is enabled, you can specify the field that will contain the filename(s) at runtime. Extension Adds a point and the extension to the end of the filename. (.txt) Include transformnr in filename If you run the transform in multiple copies (Launching several copies of a transform), the copy number is included in the filename, before the extension. (_0). Include partition nr in filename? Includes the data partition number in the filename. Include date in filename Includes the system date in the filename. (default _20041231). Include time in filename Includes the system time in the filename. (default _235959). Specify Date time format Enable to specify the date time format Date time format Chose the date time format to append to the filename Add file name to rest This adds all processed filenames to the internal result filename set to allow for further processing. Show filename(s) This option shows a list of the files that will be generated. The content tab contains the following options for describing the content being read: Option Description Append Check this to append lines to the end of the specified file. Separator Specify the character that separates the fields in a single line of text. Typically this is ; or a tab. Enclosure A pair of strings can enclose some fields. This allows separator or enclosure characters in fields. The enclosure string is optional. Force the enclosure around fields? This option forces all fields of an incoming string type (independent of the eventually changed field type within the Text File Output field definition) to be enclosed with the character specified in the Enclosure property above. Disable the enclosure fix? When a string field contains an enclosure it gets enclosed and the enclose itself gets escaped. When a string field contains a separator, it gets enclosed. Check this option, if this logic is not wanted. It has also an extra performance burden since the strings are scanned for enclosures and separators. So when you are sure there is no such logic needed since your strings don’t have these characters in there and you want to improve performance, un-check this option. Header Enable this option if you want the text file to have a header row. (First line in the file). Footer Enable this option if you want the text file to have a footer row. (Last line in the file). Note: Be careful to enable this option when in Append mode since it is not possible to strip footers from the file contents before appending new rows. There are use cases where this option is wanted, e.g. to have a footer after each run of a pipeline to separate sections within the file. Format This can be either DOS or UNIX. UNIX files have lines are separated by linefeeds. DOS files have lines separated by carriage returns and line feeds. The options are: CR+LF terminated (Windows, DOS) / LF terminated (Unix) / CR terminated / No new-line terminator Encoding Specify the text file encoding to use. Leave blank to use the default encoding on your system. To use Unicode specify UTF-8 or UTF-16. On first use, Spoon will search your system for available encodings. Compression Allows you to specify the type of compression, .zip or .gzip to use when compressing the output. Note: Only one file is placed in a single archive. Right pad fields Add spaces to the end of the fields (or remove characters at the end) until they have the specified length. Fast data dump (no formatting) Improves the performance when dumping large amounts of data to a text file by not including any formatting information. Split every …​ rows If this number N is larger than zero, split the resulting text-file into multiple parts of N rows. Add Ending line of file Allows you to specify an alternate ending row to the output file. The fields tab is where you define properties for the fields being exported. The table below describes each of the options for configuring the field properties: Option Description Schema Definition Name of the Schema Definition that we want to reference. Name The name of the field. Type Type of the field can be either String, Date or Number. Format The format mask to convert with. See Number Formats for a complete description of format symbols. Length The length option depends on the field type follows: Number - Total number of significant figures in a number String - total length of string Date - length of printed output of the string (e.g. . only gives back year) Precision The precision option depends on the field type as follows: Number - Number of floating point digits String - unused Date - unused Currency Symbol used to represent currencies like $10,000.00 or E5.000,00 Decimal A decimal point can be a \".\" (10,000.00) or \",\" (5.000,00) Group A grouping can be a \",\" (10,000.00) or \".\" (5.000,00) Trim type The trimming method to apply on the string. Note: Trimming only works when there is no field length given. Null If the value of the field is null, insert this string into the textfile Get Click to retrieve the list of fields from the input fields stream(s) Minimal width Alter the options in the fields tab in such a way that the resulting width of lines in the text file is minimal. So instead of save 0000001, we write 1, etc. String fields will no longer be padded to their specified length.","title":" Text File Output","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"textfileoutput","url":"/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/textfileoutput.html","titles":[{"text":"Description","hash":"_description","id":1},{"text":"Supported Engines","hash":"_supported_engines","id":2},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":3},{"text":"File Tab","hash":"_file_tab","id":4},{"text":"Content Tab","hash":"_content_tab","id":5},{"text":"Fields Tab","hash":"_fields_tab","id":6}]},"375":{"id":375,"text":"The Token Replacement transform replaces tokens in an input string or file.

In essence, this transform allows you to program your own plugin in a transform. The goal of this transform is not to allow a user to do full-scale Java development inside a transform. Obviously we have a whole plugin system available to help with that part. The goal is to allow users to define methods and logic with as little as code as possible, executed as fast as possible. For this we use the Janino project libraries that compile Java code in the form of classes at runtime. Hop Engine Spark Flink Dataflow Option Description Transform name Name of the transform. Class code The Java code. Fields List of output fields. Fieldname: Output field name. Type: Type of field. Length: Length of the field. Precision: Precision of the field. Parameters You can use the Parameters table to avoid using hard-coded string values, such as field names (customer for example). Tag: The parameter tag. Value: The parameter value. Description: Description of the parameter. Info transforms Additional transforms to read data from Tag Transform: Which transform to read from. Description Target transforms Destination Transform Tag Transform: Which transform to output to. Description Test class Tests the class. The Processor code defines the processRow() method, which is the heart of the transform. This method is called by the pipeline in a tight loop and will continue until false is returned. String firstnameField; String lastnameField; String nameField; public boolean processRow() throws HopException { // Let's look up parameters only once for performance reason. // if (first) { firstnameField = getParameter(\"FIRSTNAME_FIELD\"); lastnameField = getParameter(\"LASTNAME_FIELD\"); nameField = getParameter(\"NAME_FIELD\"); first=false; } // First, get a row from the default input hop // Object[] r = getRow(); // If the row object is null, we are done processing. // if (r == null) { setOutputDone(); return false; } // It is always safest to call createOutputRow() to ensure that your output row's Object[] is large // enough to handle any new fields you are creating in this transform. // Object[] outputRow = createOutputRow(r, data.outputRowMeta.size()); String firstname = get(Fields.In, firstnameField).getString(r); String lastname = get(Fields.In, lastnameField).getString(r); // Set the value in the output field // String name = firstname+\" \"+lastname; get(Fields.Out, nameField).setValue(outputRow, name); // putRow will send the row on to the default output hop. // putRow(data.outputRowMeta, outputRow); return true; If you want Hop to handle errors that may occur while running your class in a pipeline, you must implement for your own error handling code. Before adding any error handling code, right-click on the User Defined Java Class transform in the Hop client canvas and select Error Handling in the menu that appears. The resulting transform error handling settings dialog box contains options for specifying an error target transform and associated field names that you will use to implement error handling in your defined code. try { Object numList = strsList.stream() .map( new ToInteger() ) .sorted( new ReverseCase() ) .collect( Collectors.toList() ); get( Fields.Out, \"reverseOrder\" ).setValue( row, numList.toString() ); } catch (NumberFormatException ex) { // Number List contains a value that cannot be converteds to an Integer. rowInError = true; errMsg = ex.getMessage(); errCnt = errCnt + 1; } if ( !rowInError ) { putRow( data.outputRowMeta, row ); } else { // Output errors to the error hop. Right click on transform and choose \"Error Handling...\" putError(data.outputRowMeta, row, errCnt, errMsg, \"Not allowed\", \"DEC_0\"); } The try in the code sample above tests to see if numList contains valid numbers. If the list contains a number that is not valid, putError is used to handle the error and direct it to the wlog: ErrorPath transform in the sample pipeline. The ErrorPath transform is also specified in the Target transforms tab of the User Define Java Class transform. You need to implement logging in your defined transform if you want Hop to log data actions from your class, such as read, write, output, or update data. The following code is an example of how to implement logging: putRow( data.outputMeta, r ); if ( checkFeedback( getLinesOutput() ) ) { if ( log.isBasic() ) { logBasic( \"Have I got rows for you! \" + getLinesOutput() ); } } You can navigate through your defined classes along with related code snippets and fields through the Classes and Code Fragments panel. You can right-click on any item in this tree to either Delete, Rename, or Show Sample. Classes The Classes folder indicates what classes have corresponding code block tabs in the Class Code panel. Code Snippits The Code Snippits folder shows the internal Hop code related to the User Defined Java Class transform. These snippits are shown as reference for the code of your class. Input Fields The Input fields folder contains any input fields you define in your code. While working with your defined code, you will be handling input and output fields. Many ways exist for handling input fields. For example, to start, examine the following description of an input row. IRowMeta inputRowMeta = getInputRowMeta(); The inputRowMeta object contains the metadata of the input row. It includes all the fields, their data types, lengths, names, format masks, and more. You can use this object to look up input fields. For example, if you want to look for a field called customer, you would use the following code. IValueMeta customer = inputRowMeta.searchValueMeta(\"year\"); Because looking up field names can be slow if you need to do it for every row that passes through a pipeline, you could look up field names in advance in a first block of code, as shown in the following example: if (first) { yearIndex = getInputRowMeta().indexOfValue(getParameter(\"YEAR\")); if (yearIndex/plugins/transforms/janino Example: System.

Hop Engine Spark Flink Dataflow This transform is optimal for quickly processing large and complex data structures. Unlike the Get Data from XML transform, which uses in-memory processing and can require the purging of parts of files, the XML Input Stream (StAX) transform moves the processing logic into the pipeline. The transform itself provides the raw XML data stream together with additional processing information. This streaming transform is recommended when you have limitations with other transforms or need to parse XML when: You need fast data loads which are independent of the memory regardless of the file size. You need flexibility in reading various parts of the XML file in different ways, and do not want to repeatedly parse the file. Because the processing logic of some XML files can be complex, you should have a good knowledge of the existing Hop transforms when using this transform. Option Description Transform name Name of the transform. Filename File name of the input XML file. Specify your file name by entering its path or clicking Browse. If you connect to a transform that precedes the XML Input Stream transform, the Browse button is hidden, and the text box becomes a drop-down menu that is populated with the fields from the preceding transform. Select a value from the drop-down menu to use as the path to an XML file. You can use internal variables to specify the path. Source is from a previous transform Accept data from a field in a previous transform. Source field name Selects a field from the previous transform to use as XML data. Add filename to result? Adds the processed XML filename to the result of this pipeline by passing the filename of the XML input file as a value on each result row. You can then use it in subsequent transforms where you want to use the filename as a value. Skip (Elements/Attributes) Number of elements or attributes that should be skipped. Use this field for starting the processing at a specific location in a file. The file will still be loaded by the parser, but the rows will not be produced. Limit (Elements/Attributes) Limits the number of elements or attributes to process. With the Skip and Limit properties, you can enable chunk loading that is defined in an outer loop. Default String Length The default string length for the XML data name and value fields. Encoding Encodes the XML file data in the specified encoding. Add Namespace information? Adds the XML data type NAMESPACE to the stream. You can add an optional prefix (defined in the XML data name) and URI information (defined in the XML data value). This option adds a defined prefix in the ELEMENT data type to the XML data name, for example, prefix:product. Due to the extra namespace handling, this option slows down the processing throughput. Trim strings? Trims all name/value elements and attributes. It eliminates white spaces, tabs, carriage returns, and line feed characters at the beginning and end of the string. Include filename in output? / Fieldname Adds the processed file name to the specified field name. Row number in output? / Fieldname Adds the processed row number (starting with 1) to the specified field name. XML data type (numeric) in output? / Fieldname Adds the processed data type in numeric format to the specified field name. The following data types are defined: 0 - \"UNKNOWN\" (Reserved) 1 - \"START_ELEMENT\" 2 - \"END_ELEMENT\" 3 - \"PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION\" (Reserved) 4 - \"CHARACTERS\" 5 - \"COMMENT\" (Reserved) 6 - \"SPACE\" (Reserved) 7 - \"START_DOCUMENT\" 8 - \"END_DOCUMENT\" 9 - \"ENTITY_REFERENCE\" (Reserved) 10-\"ATTRIBUTE\" 11-\"DTD\" (Reserved) 12-\"CDATA\" (Reserved) 13-\"NAMESPACE\" (When namespace information is selected) 14-\"NOTATION_DECLARATION\" (Reserved) 15-\"ENTITY_DECLARATION\" (Reserved). XML data type (description) in output? / Fieldname Adds the processed data type in text format to the specified field name. This option should be used instead of the numeric data type for better readability of the pipeline. See the XML data type (numeric) description above for a list of values. Because this option can cause slower processing of strings and extra memory consumption, it is recommended to use the numeric data type format for big data loads XML location line in output? / Fieldname Adds the processed source XML location line to the specified field name. XML location column in output? / Fieldname Adds the processed source XML location column to the specified field name. XML element ID in output? / Fieldname Adds the processed element number (starting with '0') to the specified field name. In contrast to adding the Row number, this field number is incremented by the count of each new element and not the row number. This numbering ensures that the nesting between levels is correct. XML parent element ID in output? / Fieldname Adds the parent element number to the specified field name. When you use the XML element ID with the XML parent element ID, a complete XML element tree is available for later usage. XML element level in output? / Fieldname Adds the processed element level to the specified field name, starting with '0' for the root START_ and END_DOCUMENT. XML path in output? / Fieldname Adds the processed XML path to the specified field name. XML parent path in output? / Fieldname Adds the processed XML parent path to the specified field name. XML data name in output? / Fieldname Adds the processed data name of elements, attributes, and optional namespace prefixes to the specified field name.

You can use it through the File / Import from Kettle/PDI menu in the Hop GUI or using the hop-import script with the --type kettle option. In general the plugin copies Kettle files and non-Kettle files. File Conversion Transformations Kettle transformation files (.ktr extension) are converted to Hop pipelines. During this process the XML metadata is converted to the appropriate Hop format. Jobs Kettle job files (.kjb extension) are converted to Hop workflows. During this process the XML metadata is converted to the appropriate Hop format. kettle.properties The Kettle properties file in your .kettle folder (typically found in the home directory or ${KETTLE_HOME}) often contains variables and values regarding your environment. These variables and values are converted into an environment configuration file if you specified the -c or --target-config-file option. When you create an environment in Hop you can simply add this file to it to make everything work. If the configuration file already exists it will be updated, not overwritten. The description of the newly imported variables is set to Imported from Kettle to indicate that it’s new. Values of existing variables are overwritten and the existing description is kept. shared.xml The shared.xml file in your .kettle folder (typically found in the home directory or ${KETTLE_HOME}) often contains connections which are shared across many transformations and jobs.

A project is the collection of all the files you need in your data orchestration solution. This typically includes metadata, pipelines, workflows, reference files, documentation and so on. To match standard development best practices you would check all these files into a version control system like git. What are typically not included in this set of files are the variable values that you want to make the project run correctly in a certain environment. For example on a development laptop you might want to set a variable DB_HOSTNAME to localhost and on a production server this value might point to the production database server. Because of this you can define (Project Lifecycle) Environments in Hop which wrap around a project by name and include one or more configuration files. You want these configuration files to be stored outside of the project folder and perhaps into a separate version control repository. The 2 main things that define a project are its name and its home folder. Projects and environments as such are defined in the central Hop configuration file hop-config.json. By default this file lives in the config/ folder of your Hop client distribution. You can change that folder by setting the HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER environment variable on your system. In hop-config.json you’ll find a \"projectsConfig\" section. By default it contains the following: { \"projectsConfig\" : { \"enabled\" : true, \"projectMandatory\" : true, \"environmentMandatory\" : false, \"defaultProject\" : \"default\", \"defaultEnvironment\" : null, \"standardParentProject\" : \"default\", \"standardProjectsFolder\" : null, \"projectConfigurations\" : [ { \"projectName\" : \"default\", \"projectHome\" : \"config/projects/default\", \"configFilename\" : \"project-config.json\" }, { \"projectName\" : \"samples\", \"projectHome\" : \"config/projects/samples\", \"configFilename\" : \"project-config.json\" } ], \"lifecycleEnvironments\" : [ ], \"projectLifecycles\" : [ ] } } As you can see the standard Hop client distribution defines 2 projects: default and samples. Every project has extra metadata and settings stored in a project configuration file called project-config.json. For the samples project this would be config/projects/samples/project-config.json. Let’s take a look at it: { \"metadataBaseFolder\" : \"${PROJECT_HOME}/metadata\", \"unitTestsBasePath\" : \"${PROJECT_HOME}\", \"dataSetsCsvFolder\" : \"${PROJECT_HOME}/datasets\", \"enforcingExecutionInHome\" : true, \"parentProjectName\" : \"default\", \"config\" : { \"variables\" : [ ] } } You can define variables on a project level as well. This makes it handy to reference things like input and output folders which are not sensitive to being checked into version control. As you can see from the project configuration file, a project can have a parent from which it will inherit all the metadata objects as well as all the variables that are defined in it. The main toolbar in the Hop GUI offers buttons to add, edit and delete a project. The hop-conf script offers many options to edit everything projects related. Please note that these commands never change the content of a project itself. They only change the way it is configured on your system. $ sh hop-conf.sh --project-create --project hop2 --project-home /home/user/projects/hop2 --project-parent default Creating project 'hop2' Project 'hop2' was created for home folder : /home/user/projects/hop2 Configuration file for project 'hop2' was saved to : /home/user/projects/hop2/project-config.json This command adds a variable to the project configuration: $ sh hop-conf.sh --project-modify --project hop2 --project-variables INPUT_FOLDER=input/ Project configuration for 'hop2' was modified in /config/hop-config.json Project settings for 'hop2' were modified in file /home/user/projects/hop2/project-config.json If we look at the project-config.json file we’ll see that the variable/value pair was added: { \"config\" : { \"variables\" : [ { \"name\" : \"INPUT_FOLDER\", \"value\" : \"input/\" } ] } } The following deletes a project from the Hop configuration file: $ sh hop-conf.sh -pd -p hop2 Project 'hop2 was removed from the configuration Environment is short for Project Lifecycle Environment. It describes the phase of a project in its lifecycle moving from Development to Test to Acceptance to Production. It can also describe a project in a continuous integration environment and so on. As such the following attributes define an environment: Its name The name of the project The phase The configuration files you want to use to define the environment specific variables The main toolbar in the Hop GUI offers buttons to add, edit and delete an environment. Please note that you can add non-existing configuration files in the environment dialog. When editing the Hop GUI will ask you if you want to create the file. The hop-conf script offers many options to edit environment definitions. $ sh hop-conf.sh \\ --environment-create \\ --environment hop2 \\ --environment-project hop2 \\ --environment-purpose=Development \\ --environment-config-files=/home/user/projects/hop2-conf.json Creating environment 'hop2' Environment 'hop2' was created in Hop configuration file /config/hop-config.json 2021/02/01 16:37:02 - General - ERROR: Configuration file '/home/user/projects/hop2-conf.json' does not exist to read variables from.

If we look at the file hop2-conf.json we’ll see that the variables were added: { \"variables\" : [ { \"name\" : \"DB_HOSTNAME\", \"value\" : \"localhost\", \"description\" : \"\" }, { \"name\" : \"DB_PASSWORD\", \"value\" : \"abcd\", \"description\" : \"\" } ] } Please note that you can add descriptions for the variables as well with the --describe-variable option. Please run hop-conf without options to see all the possibilities. The following deletes an environment from the Hop configuration file: $ $ sh hop-conf.sh --environment-delete --environment hop2 Lifecycle environment 'hop2' was deleted from Hop configuration file /config/hop-config.json You can specify an environment or a project when executing a pipeline or a workflow. By doing so you are automatically configuring metadata, variables without too much fuss. The easiest example is shown by executing the \"complex\" pipeline from the Apache Beam examples: $ sh hop-run.sh --project samples --file 'beam/pipelines/complex.hpl' --runconfig Direct 2022/12/15 14:40:51 - HopRun - Enabling project 'hop-samples' 2022/12/15 14:40:51 - HopRun - Relative path filename specified: /hop/config/projects/samples/beam/pipelines/complex.hpl 2022/12/15 14:40:51 - HopRun - Starting pipeline: /hop/config/projects/samples/beam/pipelines/complex.hpl 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Created Apache Beam pipeline with name 'complex' 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Handled transform (INPUT) : Customer data 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Handled transform (INPUT) : State data 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Handled Group By (TRANSFORM) : countPerState, gets data from 1 previous transform(s) 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : uppercase state, gets data from 1 previous transform(s), targets=0, infos=0 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Handled Merge Join (TRANSFORM) : Merge join 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : Lookup count per state, gets data from 1 previous transform(s), targets=0, infos=1 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : name<n, gets data from 1 previous transform(s), targets=2, infos=0 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Transform Label: N-Z reading from previous transform targeting this one using : name<n - TARGET - Label: N-Z 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : Label: N-Z, gets data from 1 previous transform(s), targets=0, infos=0 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Transform Label: A-M reading from previous transform targeting this one using : name<n - TARGET - Label: A-M 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : Label: A-M, gets data from 1 previous transform(s), targets=0, infos=0 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : Switch / case, gets data from 2 previous transform(s), targets=4, infos=0 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Transform CA reading from previous transform targeting this one using : Switch / case - TARGET - CA 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : CA, gets data from 1 previous transform(s), targets=0, infos=0 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Transform NY reading from previous transform targeting this one using : Switch / case - TARGET - NY 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : NY, gets data from 1 previous transform(s), targets=0, infos=0 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Transform FL reading from previous transform targeting this one using : Switch / case - TARGET - FL 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : FL, gets data from 1 previous transform(s), targets=0, infos=0 2022/12/15 14:40:54 - General - Transform Default reading from previous transform targeting this one using : Switch / case - TARGET - Default 2022/12/15 14:40:55 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : Default, gets data from 1 previous transform(s), targets=0, infos=0 2022/12/15 14:40:55 - General - Handled generic transform (TRANSFORM) : Collect, gets data from 4 previous transform(s), targets=0, infos=0 2022/12/15 14:40:55 - General - Handled transform (OUTPUT) : complex, gets data from Collect 2022/12/15 14:40:55 - General - Executing this pipeline using the Beam Pipeline Engine with run configuration 'Direct' To execute an Apache Beam pipeline a lot of information and metadata is needed. Let’s dive into a few fun information tidbits: By referencing the samples project Hop knows where the project is located (config/projects/samples) Since we know the location of the project, we can specify pipelines and workflows with a relative path The project knows where its metadata is stored (config/projects/samples/metadata) so it knows where to find the Direct pipeline run configuration (config/projects/samples/metadata/pipeline-run-configuration/Direct.json) This run configuration defines its own pipeline engine specific variables, in this case the output folder : DATA_OUTPUT=${PROJECT_HOME}/beam/output/ The output of the samples is as such written to config/projects/samples/beam/output To reference an environment you can execute using -e or --environment. The only difference is that you’ll have a number of extra environment variables set while executing. There are various options to configure the behavior of the Projects plugin itself. In Hop configuration file hop-config.json we can find the following options: { \"projectMandatory\" : true, \"environmentMandatory\" : false, \"defaultProject\" : \"default\", \"defaultEnvironment\" : null, \"standardParentProject\" : \"default\", \"standardProjectsFolder\" : \"/home/matt/test-stuff/\" } Option Description hop-conf option projectMandatory This will prevent anyone from using hop-run without specifying a project --project-mandatory environmentMandatory This will prevent anyone from using hop-run without specifying an environment --environment-mandatory defaultProject The default project to use when none is specified --default-project defaultEnvironment The default environment to use when none is specified --default-environment standardParentProject The standard parent project to propose when creating new project --standard-parent-project standardProjectsFolder The folder to which you’ll browse by default in the GUI when creating new projects --standard-projects-folder","title":"Projects & Environments","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"projects","url":"/manual/latest/plugins/projects/projects.html","titles":[{"text":"Architecture","hash":"_architecture","id":1},{"text":"Projects","hash":"_projects","id":2},{"text":"Variables","hash":"_variables","id":3},{"text":"Parent projects","hash":"_parent_projects","id":4},{"text":"Configuration using Hop GUI","hash":"_configuration_using_hop_gui","id":5},{"text":"Configuration on the command line","hash":"_configuration_on_the_command_line","id":6},{"text":"Creating a project","hash":"_creating_a_project","id":7},{"text":"Modifying a project","hash":"_modifying_a_project","id":8},{"text":"Deleting a project","hash":"_deleting_a_project","id":9},{"text":"Environments","hash":"_environments","id":10},{"text":"Configuration using Hop GUI","hash":"_configuration_using_hop_gui_2","id":11},{"text":"Configuration on the command line","hash":"_configuration_on_the_command_line_2","id":12},{"text":"Creating an environment","hash":"_creating_an_environment","id":13},{"text":"Setting variables in an environment","hash":"_setting_variables_in_an_environment","id":14},{"text":"Deleting an environment","hash":"_deleting_an_environment","id":15},{"text":"Running pipelines and workflows","hash":"_running_pipelines_and_workflows","id":16},{"text":"Plugin configuration","hash":"_plugin_configuration","id":17}]},"397":{"id":397,"text":"The items below will make your Apache Hop project easier to manage, to monitor and to maintain.

A clearly organized project makes it easier to find the workflows, pipelines and other project artefacts, and makes your project easier to maintain overall. Your naming convention should not only cover all aspects of your projects. For Apache Hop, that means conventions for your workflows, pipelines, transforms, actions and metadata items. There’s more to your project than just Apache Hop, and other areas of your project are no exception. Input and output files, database tables etc will be a lot easier to manage if named clearly, cleanly and consistently. For larger projects, a formal naming conventions document helps to centrally manage the naming conventions, and helps to avoid confusion when different team members use their own naming conventions interchangeably. A naming convention should be maintained, updated, enforced and verified periodically. Automated naming convention checks (e.g. through scripts in commit hooks) could be considered to automate the validation of your naming conventions. Clearly named transforms and actions make your pipelines and workflows a lot easier to understand. The default action and transform names use the action or transform name. This makes it easy to understand what the transform does, but tell you nothing about the purpose it has in your workflow or pipeline. Filter rows (or god forbid, Filter rows 2 2 or similar names you get after copy/pasting transforms) doesn’t tell you anything. A short but concise transform name like start_date < today tells you exactly what is going on in a filter transform. For example, for input and output files, you could use the filename you’re reading from or writing to. You can use (copy/paste) any unicode character in the name of a transform or action and even newlines are allowed. Metadata item names like relational database connections should immediately tell you what data they contain or what their purpose is. Metadata item names shouldn’t contain technical or environment details. For example, if your CRM system runs in a Postgresql database, CRM is fine as a name. Your connection is configured for an Oracle database, so that doesn’t need to be repeated in the name. Environment information should be configured in your project lifecycle environments, so there’s no need to include dev, test or prod in your connection names. Organizing your project in clearly named folders and subfolders makes everything easier to find, to organize and to maintain. Avoid keeping tens or hundreds of workflow files in a single folder.","title":"","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"naming-conventions","url":"/manual/latest/snippets/best-practices/naming-conventions.html","titles":[{"text":"Naming conventions","hash":"NamingConventions","id":1},{"text":"Transform and action names","hash":"_transform_and_action_names","id":2},{"text":"Metadata","hash":"_metadata","id":3},{"text":"Project folders and subfolders","hash":"_project_folders_and_subfolders","id":4}]},"403":{"id":403,"text":"Here are a few things to consider when looking at performance in a pipeline: Pipelines are networks: the speed of the network is limited by the slowest transform in it.

A graph is made up of nodes and relationships (also called edges). Relationships link up Nodes and both can have any number of properties. In that regard a graph is different from your typical 'relational database' which hints at the typical challenge when loading data into Neo4j and getting it back out: converting between relational and graph data. In this document we’ll sketch some possibilities to get started. To make the Neo4j examples work in the neo4j/ folder of your samples project you need to configure a few variables: NEO4J_HOSTNAME : The Neo4j server hostname NEO4J_PORT : The neo4j database port (default is 7687) NEO4J_USERNAME : The username NEO4J_PASSWORD : The password These variables can be easily set by creating a new environment which represents your situation. Create a new environment configuration file and set the variables in there. The Graph Output transform is a useful transform which is capable of updating multiple nodes and relationships at the same time. To get started with this transform you can take a look at workflow neo4j/beers-wikipedia-graph.hwf. This workflow takes the following actions: Ping Neo4j: Perform a network ping to the Neo4j server to see if it’s reachable. Check Neo4j: connect to the Neo4j server and returns a static value from it to see if it’s working as expected Create indexes for graph model Belgian Beers: Create indexes to get great performance when updating nodes or relationships Create constraints for graph model Belgian Beers: Create constraints to guarantee uniqueness of primary key properties Read and scrub the data: Load the raw HTML from wikipedia containing a table with Belgian Beers information. This information is scrubbed (cleaned up) and translated to English. Load data into a graph: Data is loaded into Neo4j using the Belgian Beers graph model and a field-to-graph mapping. The way that data is mapped to a graph model is quite simple. Take the Graph Output transform in the data loading pipeline: As you can see above this transform doesn’t require any technical knowledge. You can use the \"Map fields\" button to use a GUI to map the input fields on the left with the various node and relationship properties in your graph model. You can also do this manually. The Neo4j Output transform is useful for simple data loading into one node, two nodes and/or a relationship. It doesn’t require any knowledge of Cypher to use. Take a look at workflow neo4j/neo4j-output-parallel-load.hpl: In this particular example we simply map the fields into the properties of a single node so we can use the Neo4j Output transform instead of Graph Output described above. The advantage is in this case that we have a simpler mapping and can potentially load data faster. There is also no need for a graph model so this transform is great to handle simple scenarios very quickly without any fuss. What this sample also showcases is that you can load larger data sets in parallel. In fact this pipeline has a parameter called COPIES set to 4 by default which will load into Neo4j in 4 different threads in parallel. The Neo4j Cypher transform is the Swiss army knife in our Neo4j toolbox. It’s capable of doing pretty much everything Neo4j related if you have knowledge of Cypher. In example neo4j/neo4j-cypher-unwind-simple.hpl: In this particular example we always use the same Cypher statement. This allows us to group input data so we can use an UNWIND command which will dramatically speed up the performance. It’s a step up from batching different commands together. The first thing we need to do is collect all the input rows (mapped to parameter values) into a values map (on the Options tab): The parameters you want to pass to the Cypher statement are listed on the Parameters tab. Finally, we can construct the Cypher statement itself: UNWIND $events AS event MERGE (y:Year { year: event.year }) MERGE (y)<-[:IN]-(e:Event { id: event.id }) RETURN e.id AS x ORDER BY x Sometimes you might want to remove sets of data from Neo4j or indeed everything, for example during testing (see the Neo4j integration tests of the Hop project for examples). The included example is called neo4j/cleanup-remove-everything.hwf The way indexes and constraints are removed is by calling db.indexes() or db.constraints() and by iterating over those values to remove all of them. Nodes and relationships are deleted in batches to reduce the strain on the Neo4j database transaction handler. That handler might have a hard time deleting very large amounts of nodes or relationships because Neo4j is an ACID compliant database. As mentioned above, the Neo4j Cypher transform can not only be used to load data but also to retrieve it. Example pipeline neo4j/neo4j-cypher-complex-returns.hpl shows how to return complex data types like List, Map and Node from a Neo4j graph: The way this happens is that Node, Relationship and Path values can be mapped to Hop Graph or String (in JSON format) output fields. Neo4j List and Map data types are always converted to String fields in JSON format. Those can then be processed further in the rest of the pipeline. Sometimes we want to load years of historical data before we start updating our graph. In this case we can use the tool neo4j-admin import. This tool is designed to be very fast in bulk loading large amounts of data into a new graph database. It works by loading CSV files which are expected to be in a particular format to describe the various nodes and relationships in a graph. To help out with imports we have a number of tools at your disposal: The Graph data type: transforms Neo4j Output and Neo4j Graph Output have options to write their output to a field of type Graph. These transforms are capable of flagging the primary key field of nodes which encapsulates enough information to generate CSV files with…​ Neo4j Split Graph : With this transform we can split up the multiple nodes and relationships stored in a single Graph field produced by the Graph Output transform. You can then filter out particular nodes or relationships to guarantee uniqueness or other post processing. Neo4j Generate CSVs : this transform will help you with the creation of the CSV files for import. Neo4j Import : this transform will generate the neo4j-admin import statement for you and execute it. It uses the list of CSV files and their types (node/relationship) to do this as well as the options you selected in the transform dialog.","title":"Working with Neo4j data","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"working-with-neo4j-data","url":"/manual/latest/technology/neo4j/working-with-neo4j-data.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Samples setup","hash":"_samples_setup","id":2},{"text":"Updating graphs","hash":"_updating_graphs","id":3},{"text":"Graph Output : The beers Wikipedia example","hash":"_graph_output_the_beers_wikipedia_example","id":4},{"text":"Neo4j Output : parallel data loading","hash":"_neo4j_output_parallel_data_loading","id":5},{"text":"Cypher : a simple unwind example","hash":"_cypher_a_simple_unwind_example","id":6},{"text":"Removing data : The Cleanup example","hash":"_removing_data_the_cleanup_example","id":7},{"text":"Retrieving data","hash":"_retrieving_data","id":8},{"text":"Cypher : complex returns","hash":"_cypher_complex_returns","id":9},{"text":"Bulk loading","hash":"_bulk_loading","id":10}]},"440":{"id":440,"text":"The Abort workflow action immediately stops (aborts) a running workflow.

Typical use cases are sending error and/or logging mails. For example, it is not uncommon at the end of a successful load, to send an email to a distribution list announcing that the load was successful and include a log file. If there are errors, an email can be sent to alert individuals on a distribution list. The Mail action requires an SMTP server. You can use authentication and security as part of the connection but you must have the SMTP credentials. You can attach files to your email messages such as error logs and regular logs.

What is a Result File and how to create one? Well, just about any file created during a pipeline may become a Result File, you only need to mark it as such. There are several ways to do that: When creating a file with a transform that supports it, allow it to mark the file as a Result File. For example the \"Text file output\" transform has the check-box \"Add filenames to result\" on the File tab for that purpose. The file type will be General. Use the transform \"Set files in result\" from the workflow category to mark a file as a result file of a particular type. This transforms expects the file name to be in a field (you can use e.g. \"Generate Rows\" in combination with \"Add constants\" to produce a row containing the file name). Attaching pipeline’s log You may easily attach a log file with log of a pipeline run by the workflow prior to sending the mail as follows (suppose we have the workflow Start → Pipeline → Mail): In the Pipeline workflow action’s options, check \"Specify logfile?\" and enter a name and extension for the file. You can also specify the desired log level. In the Mail workflow action’s options, check \"Attach files to message\" and select (at least) the file type \"Log\". The next time the mail is send, it will have the pipeline’s log attached.","title":"Mail","component":"manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"mail","url":"/manual/latest/workflow/actions/mail.html","titles":[{"text":"Description","hash":"_description","id":1},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":2},{"text":"Addresses Tab","hash":"_addresses_tab","id":3},{"text":"Server Tab","hash":"_server_tab","id":4},{"text":"Email Message Tab","hash":"_email_message_tab","id":5},{"text":"Attached Files Tab","hash":"_attached_files_tab","id":6},{"text":"Tips","hash":"_tips","id":7}]},"471":{"id":471,"text":"The Mail validator action checks if an email address is valid.

This action is the access point from your workflow to your actual data processing activity (pipeline). An example of a common workflow includes getting FTP files, checking existence of a necessary target database table, running a pipeline that populates that table, and e-mailing an error log if a pipeline fails. For this example, the Pipeline action defines which pipeline to run to populate the table. See also: The Workflow action that executes a sub-workflow from a workflow. The Workflow Executor transform that executes a workflow from a pipeline. The Pipeline Executor transform that executes a sub-pipeline from a pipeline. Option Description Action name Name of the action. Pipeline Specify your pipeline by entering in its path or clicking Browse. The selected pipelines will automatically converted to a path relative to your ${PROJECT_HOME}. For example, if your ${PROJECT_HOME} is /home/admin/hop/project/ and you select a pipeline /home/admin/hop/project/subfolder/sub.hpl than the path will automatically be converted to ${PROJECT_HOME}/subfolder/sub.hpl. Run Configuration The pipeline can run in different types of pipeline configurations. Select the desired run configuration to control where and how the pipeline is executed. Option Description Execute for every result row Runs the pipeline once for every result row from a previous pipeline (or workflow) in the current workflow. Clear results rows before execution Makes sure the results rows are cleared before the pipeline starts. Clear results files before execution Makes sure the results files are cleared before the pipeline starts. Wait for remote pipeline to finish If you selected Server as your environment type, choose this option to block the workflow until the pipeline runs on the server. Follow local abort to remote pipeline If you selected Server as your environment type, choose this option to send the local abort signal remotely. By default, if you do not set logging, Apache Hop will take generated log entries and create a log record inside the workflow. For example, suppose a workflow has three pipelines to run and you have not set logging. The pipelines will not log information to other files, locations, or special configurations. In this instance, the workflow runs and logs information into its master workflow log. In most instances, it is acceptable for logging information to be available in the workflow log. For example, if you have load dimensions, you want logs for your load dimension runs to display in the workflow logs. If there are errors in the pipelines, they will be displayed in the workflow logs. However, you want all your log information kept in one place, you must then set up logging. Option Description Specify logfile Specifies a separate logging file for running this pipeline. Name Specifies the directory and base name of the log file (C:\\logs for example). Extension Specifies the file name extension (.log or .txt for example). Log level Specifies the logging level for running the pipeline. See Logging for more details. Append logfile Appends the logfile as opposed to creating a new one. Create parent folder Creates a parent folder for the log file if it does not exist. Include date in filename Adds the system date to the filename with format YYYYMMDD (_20051231). Include time in filename Adds the system time to the filename with format HHMMSS (_235959). Pass params downstream: On the Parameters tab, select the pipeline transform checkbox to Pass parameter values to sub pipeline. The parameter must already exist in the pipeline (in pipeline properties for example) or alternatively, on the Parameters tab, you can specify new parameters. The Parameters tab allows you to override existing parameter values or NULL them by leaving the value empty. Pass field values upstream: The sub pipeline requires a Copy rows to result transform to send a row upstream. This requires a row to exist in the sub pipeline. Note that that rows do not exist in a workflow, but you can use a Get variables in a subsequent sub pipeline to use the first sub pipeline’s field values. Use Set variables if you want to pass a single value upstream from a pipeline to the workflow and act upon that variable. In this case, you can choose a scope of “valid in the parent workflow”. Option Description Copy results to parameters Copies the results from a previous pipeline as parameters of the pipeline using the Copy rows to result transform. Pass parameter values to sub pipeline Pass all parameters of the workflow down to the sub-pipeline. Parameter Specify the parameter name passed to the pipeline. Stream column name Specify the field of an incoming record from a previous pipeline as the parameter. Value Specify pipeline parameter values through one of the following actions: - Manually entering a value (ETL workflow for example). - Using another parameter to set the value (${Internal.workflow.Name} for example). - Using a combination of manually specified values and parameter values ({openvar}FILE_PREFIX}_${FILE_DATE}.txt for example).

It requires a workflow or pipeline and a run configuration to use. The action will continue to execute the specified workflow or pipeline until a condition is met: either a variable is set or a variable set to an specific optional value, or an End repeat action is triggered in a child workflow. If you use a variable name for the file to repeat, ensure a default parameter is set with a file extension so Hop knows if it is a pipeline or a workflow file. A variable set with a scope of 'valid in the JVM' in a pipeline will not be accessible upstream of a repeating pipeline. The samples project example: /loops/repeat-action.hwf and child-check-set-counter-value.hpl runs a pipeline that increments a ${COUNTER} variable with each run. If the variable values exceeds 10, a variable ${END_LOOP} is set. This variable is detected by the Repeat action, and the loop stops.

Shell allows you to do portions of your work in Apache Hop but reuse the program that reads the data tables as needed. The Shell workflow action is platform agnostic; you can use a batch file, UNIX, and so on. When you use a Shell workflow action, Hop makes a Java call to execute a program in a specified location. As an alternative to calling scripts on the host machine, you can enter scripts (e.g. batch on Windows, shell script on Linux) directly in the Shell action. The return status is provided by the operating system call.

Server poll delay (ms) The delay in milliseconds between periodic polls to the remote server.

If you don’t specify a value this defaults to 2000ms (2 seconds) Export linked resources to server? Enable this option if you want to not only send the current workflow to the server but also other referenced workflows and pipelines. See below for detailed information Named resources reference source folder This is the reference source folder for the named resources that are being used (e.g. ${PROJECT_HOME}). See below for detailed information. Named resources reference target folder This is where you expect the source folder to map to on the server (e.g. /path/on/server). See below for detailed information. This option sends not just the parent workflow to the server but also all other referenced pipelines and workflows. For example if you have pipelines or workflows referenced in actions they will be sent to the server as well. All the used pipelines and workflows together with the XML presentation of the workflow execution configuration will be sent over to the server in the form of a ZIP archive. The server receives this archive and without unzipping runs the workflow. To make this function correctly, Hop changes the references as well as references to filenames. For example ${PROJECT_HOME}/update-dimensions.hwf will be changed to ${Internal.Entry.Current.Folder}/update-dimensions.hwf. As you can see Hop will try to use a relative path to the parent file. If you have are using data files then those file names will be renamed as well. For example, you might be reading a file called ${PROJECT_HOME}/files/bigfile.csv in a CSV File Input transform. During the export the referenced filename will be changed to ${DATA_PATH_1}/bigfile.csv. For every folder that is referenced a new variable will be defined and set in the execution configuration. By default, the path set for this variable will be the same as on the executing (local) machine. On the server this might not make a lot of sense. For this reason you can specify a reference source folder like ${PROJECT_HOME} in combination with a target folder like /server/. In that example variable DATA_PATH_1 will get value /server/files/. This in turn allows you to transfer required files in advance or map a folder into a docker container and so on.

In this section we will walk through the steps needed to schedule a pipeline on Google Dataflow using Dataflow Templates. Apache Hop uses a flex template to launch a job on Google Dataflow. Before we can add a new pipeline in the Google Cloud Platform console we need to create a Google Storage bucket that contains 3 types of files. The pipelines you created using the Hop Gui and wish to schedule in Google Dataflow. Tip You can also create a Hop project using a Google Storage bucket this way you can directly create and edit Hop pipelines in GS For the pipeline to be able to use Hop metadata objects and other run configurations we need to generate a hop metadata.json file. This file can be generated from the GUI under Tools → Export metadata to JSON or using the export-metadata function from the Hop conf tool. The final part to get everything working is a metadata file used by Dataflow to stitch all the parts together. { \"defaultEnvironment\": {}, \"image\": \"apache/hop-dataflow-template:latest\", \"metadata\": { \"description\": \"This template allows you to start Hop pipelines on dataflow\", \"name\": \"Template to start a hop pipeline\", \"parameters\": [ { \"helpText\": \"Google storage location pointing to the Hop metadata file\", \"label\": \"Hop Metadata Location\", \"name\": \"hopMetadataLocation\", \"regexes\": [ \".*\" ] }, { \"helpText\": \"Google storage location pointing to the pipeline you wish to start\", \"label\": \"Hop Pipeline Location\", \"name\": \"hopPipelineLocation\", \"regexes\": [ \".*\" ] } ] }, \"sdkInfo\": { \"language\": \"JAVA\" } } Important You can change the docker image used in the metadata file Now we can go back to the console and \"Create data pipeline\" When selecting the Beam Flex template metadata file you will notice required parameters showing up.

A short-lived setup executes a pipeline or workflow and stops right after. A long-lived setup starts a Hop server and waits for work. The docker container runs a minimal Linux system called Alpine. OpenJDK version 11 is then used to execute Apache Hop. The Linux user used to execute in the container is hop and the group is hop as well. Folder Description /opt/hop The installation location of the hop client package. /files This volume has read-write permissions for Linux user hop. You can use it for example to mount a folder that contains the hop and project config as well as the workflows and pipelines. /home/hop The initial working directory location of the docker container. You can provide values for the following environment variables: Environment Variable Default Description HOP_LOG_LEVEL Basic The log level. Use one of: None, Error, Minimal, Basic, Detailed, Debug or Rowlevel. HOP_LOG_PATH /opt/hop/hop.err.log The file path to the Hop log file. HOP_PROJECT_NAME Name of the Hop project to create in the container. You also need to specify the HOP_PROJECT_FOLDER variable. If you do not set this variable, no project or environment will be created. HOP_PROJECT_FOLDER HOP_PROJECT_DIRECTORY (Deprecated) Path to the home of the Hop project. HOP_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE_NAME project-config.json Name of the project config file. HOP_ENVIRONMENT_NAME The name of the Hop environment to create in the container. If you do not set this variable, no environment will be created. When using an environment a project has to be created too HOP_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG_FILE_NAME_PATHS This is a comma separated list of paths to environment config files (including filename and file extension). HOP_OPTIONS -XX:+AggressiveHeap Any JRE options you want to set. The -XX:+AggressiveHeap option tells the container to use all memory assigned to it. HOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDERS Comma separated list to locations where JDBC drivers live (default is /lib/jdbc). HOP_CUSTOM_ENTRYPOINT_EXTENSION_SHELL_FILE_PATH Optional path to a custom entrypoint extension script file. You can use this for example to fetch Hop project files from S3 or gitlab. HOP_SYSTEM_PROPERTIES The system properties that should be set during execution. You can specify the properties as a comma separated list, e.g. PROP1=xxx,PROP2=yyy Here are the variables for short-lived containers, to execute a workflow or pipeline: Environment Variable Required Description HOP_FILE_PATH Yes The path to the Hop workflow or pipeline to execute. If you configured a project you can use a relative path to the project home folder. HOP_RUN_CONFIG Yes The name of the Hop run configuration to use to execute your pipeline or workflow. HOP_RUN_PARAMETERS No Optionally, you can specify the parameters that should be passed to the pipeline or workflow you are executing. You can specify them as a comma separated list, e.g. PARAM_1=aaa,PARAM_2=bbb. HOP_RUN_METADATA_EXPORT No You can specify a metadata export file here which will contain all required metadata elements. See also the metadata export option in the Hop Conf tool. Below are the variables you can use for a long-lived container, running Hop Server: Environment Variable Default value Description HOP_SERVER_HOSTNAME 0.0.0.0 (listen to anything) The IP address the server will listen to. HOP_SERVER_PORT 8080 The port the server will listen to. HOP_SERVER_SHUTDOWNPORT 8079 The port the server shutdown listener will listen to. HOP_SERVER_USER cluster The username to log into the Hop server. HOP_SERVER_PASS cluster The password to log into the Hop server HOP_SERVER_METADATA_FOLDER (optional) You can point to a folder containing metadata JSON files which are then available to the server. HOP_SERVER_MAX_LOG_LINES 0 (keep all logging in memory) The maximum number of log lines kept in memory by the server. HOP_SERVER_MAX_LOG_TIMEOUT 0 (never clean up log lines) The time (in minutes) it takes for a log line to be cleaned up in memory. HOP_SERVER_MAX_OBJECT_TIMEOUT 1440 (a day) The time (in minutes) it takes for a pipeline or workflow execution to be removed from the server status. HOP_SERVER_KEYSTORE (optional) The path to the Java keystore file you want to use to run the Hop server with SSL enabled to support https. HOP_SERVER_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD (optional) The password of the Java keystore file you want to use to run the Hop server with SSL enabled to support https HOP_SERVER_KEY_PASSWORD (optional) The password of the key if you want to use to run the Hop server with SSL enabled. If both passwords are the same you can omit setting this variable. Make sure to get the latest updates for the Hop image by pulling them: docker pull apache/hop: If you do not specify a value for : the value latest will be taken. Latest will contain the last officially released version of Apache Hop. You can also specify Development as a tag. That image will contain the last built Development snapshot of Apache Hop. rxq7777 The most common use case will be that you run a short-lived container to just complete one Hop workflow or pipeline. The first example below runs the sample switch-case-basic.hpl pipeline from the samples project. Replace with latest, Development or a release tag, and replace with the path to the config/projects/samples folder in your Hop installation to mount that folder as a volume. This will make the samples project folder available as the /files folder in the container. docker run -it --rm \\ --env HOP_LOG_LEVEL=Basic \\ --env HOP_FILE_PATH='${PROJECT_HOME}/transforms/switch-case-basic.hpl' \\ --env HOP_PROJECT_FOLDER=/files \\ --env HOP_PROJECT_NAME=samples \\ --env HOP_RUN_CONFIG=local \\ --name hop-test-container \\ -v :/files \\ apache/hop: The second example below runs a workflow.

For more information on the long-lived container please also see the Hop Server documentation as it describes what can be done using the Hop Server Run this command to start a Hop Server in a docker container: docker run -it --rm \\ --env HOP_SERVER_USER=admin \\ --env HOP_SERVER_PASS=admin \\ --env HOP_SERVER_SHUTDOWNPORT=8080 \\ --env HOP_SERVER_PORT=8181 \\ --env HOP_SERVER_PORT=8180 \\ --env HOP_SERVER_HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 \\ -p 8080:8080 \\ -p 8181:8181 \\ -p 8180:8180 \\ --name my-hop-server-container \\ apache/hop: localhost is a loopback to your machine, which may be the container but not the host (your laptop or server where your run the container). Use 0.0.0.0 instead to listen on all available interfaces. Hop Server is designed to receive all variables and metadata from executing clients. This means it needs little to no configuration to run. If you want to use the web-services functionality additional information on how to configure your webserver can be found on the user manual Web Service page. For this to work properly the HOP_SERVER_METADATA_FOLDER variable has to be set too. When started can then access the hop-server UI from your host at http://0.0.0.0:8181 or http://localhost:8181 To make the Hop Docker image even more flexible, we added a HOP_CUSTOM_ENTRYPOINT_EXTENSION_SHELL_FILE_PATH variable that accepts a path to a custom shell script (that you provide).This shell script will run when you start the container before your Hop project is registered with the container’s Hop config and before your Hop workflow or pipeline gets kicked off. This feature might come in handy when you want to run some custom logic upfront, e.g. source Hop project files from S3 or clone them from GitHub. The custom shell file can be provided in several ways (this is not a full list): via the mount point (/files) You create your own Dockerfile, define this image as the base and then use the COPY instruction to copy your custom shell file in your Docker image. For the last scenario mentioned, it could be something like this: We create a simple bash script called clone-git-repo.sh in a sub-folder called resources: #!/bin/bash cd /home/hop git clone ${GIT_REPO_URI} chown -R hop:hop /home/hop/${GIT_REPO_NAME} We also make it parameter-driven, so it any other team can use it.We create our custom Dockerfile like so: FROM apache/hop:Development ENV GIT_REPO_URI=https://... # example value: https://github.com/diethardsteiner/apache-hop-minimal-project.git ENV GIT_REPO_NAME=repo-name # example value: apache-hop-minimal-project USER root RUN apk update \\ && apk add --no-cache git # copy custom entrypoint extension shell script COPY --chown=hop:hop ./resources/clone-git-repo.sh /home/hop/clone-git-repo.sh USER hop Note that apart from defining the new environment variables (that go in line with the parameters we defined in the clone-git-repo.sh earlier on ), we also COPY the clone-git-repo.sh file to user hop’s home folder. Next let’s build a small script which builds our custom image and then tests it by spinning up a container and running a workflow: #!/bin/zsh DOCKER_IMG_CHECK=$(docker images | grep ds/custom-hop) if [ ! -z \"${DOCKER_IMG_CHECK}\" ]; then echo \"removing existing ds/custom-hop image\" docker rmi ds/custom-hop:latest fi docker build . -f custom.Dockerfile -t ds/custom-hop:latest echo \" ==== TESTING =====\" HOP_DOCKER_IMAGE=ds/custom-hop:latest PROJECT_DEPLOYMENT_DIR=/home/hop/apache-hop-minimal-project docker run -it --rm \\ --env HOP_LOG_LEVEL=Basic \\ --env HOP_FILE_PATH='${PROJECT_HOME}/main.hwf' \\ --env HOP_PROJECT_FOLDER=${PROJECT_DEPLOYMENT_DIR} \\ --env HOP_PROJECT_NAME=apache-hop-minimum-project \\ --env HOP_ENVIRONMENT_NAME=dev \\ --env HOP_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG_FILE_NAME_PATHS=${PROJECT_DEPLOYMENT_DIR}/dev-config.json \\ --env HOP_RUN_CONFIG=local \\ --env HOP_CUSTOM_ENTRYPOINT_EXTENSION_SHELL_FILE_PATH=/home/hop/clone-git-repo.sh \\ --env GIT_REPO_URI=https://github.com/diethardsteiner/apache-hop-minimal-project.git \\ --env GIT_REPO_NAME=apache-hop-minimal-project \\ --name my-simple-hop-container \\ ${HOP_DOCKER_IMAGE}","title":"Docker container","component":"tech-manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"docker-container","url":"/tech-manual/latest/docker-container.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Operating system","hash":"_operating_system","id":2},{"text":"Container Folder Structure","hash":"_container_folder_structure","id":3},{"text":"Environment Variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":4},{"text":"Updating the Hop docker container image","hash":"_updating_the_hop_docker_container_image","id":5},{"text":"How to run the Container","hash":"_how_to_run_the_container","id":6},{"text":"Custom Entrypoint Extension Shell Script","hash":"_custom_entrypoint_extension_shell_script","id":7}]},"521":{"id":521,"text":"","title":"Getting Started","component":"tech-manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"getting-started","url":"/tech-manual/latest/getting-started.html","titles":[]},"522":{"id":522,"text":"The Apache Hop logo should be used as the main reference to the Apache Hop project.

The integration tests run as a daily build on Jenkins and can be found here. There are two possible scenarios that you can follow, the first is adding a test to one of the existing projects containing tests. The second scenario is creating a new project. First start by creating a local clone of the Apache Hop repository, instruction to do this can be found here. Open the Hop gui and add one of the integration testing projects to your gui In this example we will be opening the transforms project and add an extra test in this project. When the UI asks to add an environment or lifecycle press no, using this is not supported naming convention inside the project when taking a look inside the project you will see a distinct naming pattern is used. each test consists of one workflow and one or more pipelines to execute the test. The workflow must always start with main- followed by number and a logical explanation of what the test is checking. the pipelines linked to the workflow start with the same number the workflow uses to make a clear distinction which pipelines are linked to which test. The workflows themselves can be straightforward, the exit code (success/abort) is used to determine if the workflow has passed or failed. note You can also make an integration test to test something that must fail. Then you simply link the false hop to a success and the true hop to an abort action. create a unit test Now you can add your own workflow to the project folder. Make sure you have a GitHub Issue number you can refer to when creating a pull request. You can also add a new project to the integration test folder. Give the project a meaningful name that explains the subject you will be testing. important the project should have a workflow engine named local You can also run the integration tests on your local system. There are 2 ways the integration tests can be run on your local system The entire test suite is available as a docker compose script to use this use following commands. This include all services available and needed for the tests. You need version 1.27.0 or higher of docker-compose Clean build HOP cd hop mvn clean install Run the Docker Compose script cd integration-tests/scripts ./run-tests-docker.sh # Optionally you can run a single project by adding the PROJECT_NAME variable to the script ./run-tests-docker.sh PROJECT_NAME=database Surefire Reports We generate xml reports that can be used by Jenkins to generate reports. these result reports can be found in the integration-tests/surefire-reports folder. A script is also provided to run the test without using Docker. This script is also used inside the automated test suite but can be used in a stand alone mode. This script can be found at following location hop/integration-tests/scripts/run-tests.sh. Be sure to export the needed system variables for the script to find the correct paths to run the tests. You can aslo run a single project by adding the project name to the command ./run-tests.sh projectname In some cases you want to check the logs to see if a specific value is present to mark your test as passed or failed. The script used in main-0001-static-partitioning can be helpful. Code used in JavaScript Action in the workflow: var txt = previous_result.getLogText(); var ok = true; var expectedVariables = [ \"partitioned.0 - Internal.Transform.Partition.ID = P1\", \"partitioned.1 - Internal.Transform.Partition.ID = P2\", \"partitioned.2 - Internal.Transform.Partition.ID = P3\" ]; for (var i = 0 ; i<expectedVariables.length ; i++) { var expectedVariable = expectedVariables[i]; if ( !txt.contains(expectedVariable)) { ok = false; log.logError(\"Expected variable expression '\"+expectedVariable+\"' was not logged at least once\"); } } var expectedValues = [ \"partitioned.1 - id = 1\", \"partitioned.2 - id = 2\", \"partitioned.0 - id = 3\", \"partitioned.1 - id = 4\", \"partitioned.2 - id = 5\", \"partitioned.0 - id = 6\", \"partitioned.1 - id = 7\", \"partitioned.2 - id = 8\", \"partitioned.0 - id = 9\", \"partitioned.1 - id = 10\", ]; for (var i = 0 ; i<expectedValues.length ; i++) { var expectedValue = expectedValues[i]; if ( !txt.contains(expectedValue)) { ok = false; log.logError(\"Value logged as '\"+expectedValue+\"' was not logged at least once\"); } } ok; This script reads the log returned by the previous pipeline and parses it to search for values. All files that are shipped with Apache software need to contain the Apache Software Foundation’s header. This also applies to all workflows and pipelines that are shipped as integration tests, samples or in any other form. To spare contributors the pain of manually having to add the ASF license header in workflows and pipeline, Hop Gui supports the HOP_LICENSE_HEADER_FILE project variable. Set this variable in your project and point it to a file containing the ASF Header’s text, e.g. integration-tests/asf-header.txt to let Hop include the ASF header in all of your workflows and pipelines. As with any other piece of code, run mvn apache-rat:check to verify all files contain the correct headers before contributing your test or sample workflows and pipelines.","title":"Integration Testing","component":"dev-manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"integration-testing","url":"/dev-manual/latest/integration-testing.html","titles":[{"text":"Adding tests to an existing project","hash":"_adding_tests_to_an_existing_project","id":1},{"text":"Adding a new project","hash":"_adding_a_new_project","id":2},{"text":"Running tests locally","hash":"_running_tests_locally","id":3},{"text":"Docker Compose","hash":"_docker_compose","id":4},{"text":"Testing script","hash":"_testing_script","id":5},{"text":"Special checks","hash":"_special_checks","id":6},{"text":"Set the HOP_LICENSE_HEADER_FILE project variable","hash":"_set_the_hop_license_header_file_project_variable","id":7}]},"534":{"id":534,"text":"Weblate official website: https://weblate.org Weblate documentation: https://docs.weblate.org Weblate source code: https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate Apache Hop project translation address: https://translate.project-hop.org You can go to the Apache Hop project translation page and participate in the translation work of the project. Thank you for your participation. The message bundles that contains the translations for the various parts of Hop are part of the source code. If you want to start any i18n efforts we recommend that you set up your development environment first as described here: Setting up your development environment In the Hop configuration file hop-config.json there is an entry called LocaleDefault which points to the locale string that you want to use. Such a locale string is always in the format: language code, underscore and country. For example, the default is en_US for English in the US. You can change the locale you want to use in the configuration file or in the Hop GUI under the Tools / options menu. Suppose we’re working on a class in file src/main/java/org/apache/hop/p1/Foo.java What we want to do is have an easy way to get our hands on a translated String. The easiest way to do this is with the standard BaseMessages class. For example, you can see the following pop up all over the place in the Apache Hop source code: org.apache.hop.i18n.BaseMessages.getString(PKG, \"Foo.MyMessage\"); If references a PKG variable typically defined at the top of the class like this: private static final Class PKG = Foo.class; By doing this we know the location of the message bundles that will be used for translations. In this case the message bundles will be looked for in src/main/resources/org/apache/hop/p1/messages/ For the default locale en_US it will point to a file called messages_en_US.properties in that folder: src/main/resources/org/apache/hop/p1/messages/messages_en_US.properties In that file we can place an entry: Foo.MyMessage = My own personal message Many plugin and GUI annotations support i18n as well. Unfortunately it is not possible to use the method explained above to resolve keys into strings. Because of this we use the following format: i18n:package:key For example, the main File menu in the Hop GUI is defined with an annotation: @GuiMenuElement( root = ID_MAIN_MENU, id = ID_MAIN_MENU_FILE, label = \"i18n::HopGui.Menu.File\", parentId = ID_MAIN_MENU) With the i18n: prefix the Hop GUI registry knows that it can translate this using the given package and key. If there is no package defined it simply means: use the package from the current class. In our example it is org.apache.hop.ui.hopgui which means that we can find the message bundles for this class in ui/src/main/resources/org/apache/hop/ui/hopgui/messages/ and for locale en_US in : ui/src/main/resources/org/apache/hop/ui/hopgui/messages/messages_en_US.properties In there we can find the English translation: ...

Any Plain Old Java Object can be used as a starting point. This annotation signals to the Metadata plugin type that there is something worth looking at. The class which carries this annotation will contain the metadata. Here are the attributes of the @HopMetadata annotation: key : this uniquely identifies the plugin and will be the name of the folder in which the metadata resides when serialising to JSON (see below) name : a human-readable name description : an extended description image : the path to an image which helps identify the metadata in the Hop GUI The class with this annotation will be found either because it lives in the plugins/ folder of Hop or if it’s an internal class and is described in the file engine/src/main/resources/hop-metadata-plugins.xml Example: PartitionSchema.java All properties you want to have as part of the shared Hop Metadata should get the @HopMetadataProperty annotation. All top level classes flagged with @HopMetadata should have a name property of type String. Here are the @HopMetadataProperty attributes: key : optional key if you want it to be different from the name of the field password: set this to true if you want the String field to be encoded using the TwoWayPasswordEncoder of the IHopMetadataProvider interface. storeWithName: if you want to store a reference to another shared metadata object, you can set this to true, otherwise all the properties of the object will be stored. Here are the supported data types: enum : any enum is serialized using its name String : also see the password attribute above. Integer / int Long / long Boolean / boolean java.util.Date java.util.Map java.util.List : with T any of the data types listed here. POJO : Any class with more @HopMetadataProperty annotations in it. You also want to have a way to edit the metadata in the GUI. This can be done by extending the class MetadataEditor. Example: PartitionSchemaEditor.java The path to the Editor class will be found automatically by looking at the name of the metadata plugin class and then simply by appending Editor to it. If you prefer to keep metadata and GUI code separate the Hop GUI will also look in package org.apache.hop.ui instead of org.apache.hop Working examples: org.apache.hop.path.to.MyMetadata → org.apache.hop.path.to.MyMetadataEditor org.apache.hop.partition.PartitionSchema → org.apache.hop.ui.partition.PartitionSchemaEditor createControl() : create the various controls on the given parent Composite. The composite has a FormLayout set. setWidgetsContent(): Using the metadata object (or getMetadata()) you can set the content on the created controls. getWidgetsContent(): Grab the values of the various controls and modify the metadata save(): verify settings, grab metadata and call super.save() setFocus(): sets the focus on the metadata dialog or tab. Choose the control to set the focus to (usually the name). createButtonsForButtonBar(): if you want to add buttons at the bottom to do things like testing, viewing, …​ you can use this method As mentioned above, the key or ID the @HopMetadata plugin is used as a top level folder to store objects in. For the serialisation to JSON most simple data types are supported. However we suggest you use the KISS principle. If you want to serialize interfaces (for example like IDatabase used by DatabaseMeta) you might want to flag the interface with the @HopMetadataObject annotation. This annotation allows you to specify an object factory for those classes. Such an object factory implements interface IHopMetadataObjectFactory with the 2 following methods: public Object createObject( String id, Object parentObject ) throws HopException → Creates an object using an ID. The parent object is often another metadata object. You can use it to check if it implements IVariables so you can inherit variables from there. public String getObjectId( Object object ) throws HopException → Retrieves the object ID from the given object. We recommend that you check the instance of the object until the factory interface supports generics.

Hop keeps a central registry of all the available Hop plugins. They are organized per plugin type (see below). The registry also keeps track of the class loaders that were created and used for the various plugins to avoid duplication. You can get a hold of this plugin registry at any place using PluginRegistry.getInstance() Plugins allow you to extend Hop functionality in over 20 different areas. Each of these plugin types are represented by a class which implements IPluginType For your convenience you can extend a class called BasePluginType. The responsibility of these classes is to register plugins of the given type in the Hop Plugin Registry. It looks for these plugins in various ways: It reads an XML file if the plugin classes to load are in the classpath. This technique is used for the core plugins and a number of GUI plugins. You can find them in core/src/resources, engine/src/resources and ui/src/resources. The location of the file is defined using the getXmlPluginFile() method. It scans the plugins/ subfolders and scans the jar files on the lookout for classes that have the annotation and interface specified in the plugin type. It then loads these classes and adds them to the plugin registry. You can use the plugin registry to search for plugins using an ID, a class name. You can list all plugins and types. Plugins contain a lot of information and implement the IPlugin interface. Here are a few of the main fields: Field Type Optional Description ids String[] Mandatory The unique ID of the plugin within its type. A plugin can have more than 1 ID to make it possible to merge multiple plugins into one and still remain backward compatible. name String Optional The name of the plugin as shown in the user interface description String Optional The description of the plugin as shown in the user interface category String Optional used to organize certain types of plugins in the UI, for example transforms and actions imageFile String Optional The path to the SVG file representing the icon of this plugin. documentationUrl String Optional The URL of the documentation for the plugin keywords String[] Optional The keywords which represent this plugin to make it easier to find it in the UI nativePlugin boolean false Indicates if the plugin can be found in the classpath (using XML or API) or in a plugin classpath Aside from this list you can find the main class, the libraries in the plugin classpath and so on. The information in the IPlugin objects is copied from the plugin annotations on the plugin classes by the PluginType class. In Hop all optional plugins are in the hop/plugins folder which contains the plugin categories: database: relational database plugins actions: workflow actions engines: pipeline and workflow engines transforms: pipeline transforms vfs: Virtual Files System plugins misc: miscellaneous plugins. Pick this category only when other plugin types don’t fit. Once you identified the category, create the plugin as a new maven sub module by carefully mentioning parent in your plugin pom file and adding new module in the parent project. This ensures adding the new plugin into maven build cycle. You can duplicate the reference plugin mentioned above as a starting point. When duplicating take time to modify the documentation and remove irrelevant to get the skeleton. THOUGHT: Can we create maven archetype? Contribution welcome. To add the plugins into final artifacts, you need to add it to hop/assemblies/plugins directory under right category as a maven sub module by carefully mentioning parent in your plugin pom file and adding new module in the parent project. This ensures adding the new plugin into maven build cycle. Define src/assembly/assembly.xml with necessary dependent jars required for the plugin to function. Review the jars which end up going into the plugin zip. If any jar which is already present in hop/lib directory, exclude it. This is done to keep the target hop artifact size as small as possible.","title":"Hop Plugin Development","component":"dev-manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"plugin-development","url":"/dev-manual/latest/plugin-development.html","titles":[{"text":"Plugin Registry","hash":"_plugin_registry","id":1},{"text":"Plugin types","hash":"_plugin_types","id":2},{"text":"Plugins","hash":"_plugins","id":3},{"text":"Where are the Hop plugins?","hash":"_where_are_the_hop_plugins","id":4},{"text":"Actions","hash":"_actions","id":5},{"text":"Steps to add new plugin","hash":"_steps_to_add_new_plugin","id":6},{"text":"Create skeleton","hash":"_create_skeleton","id":7},{"text":"Add to assemblies","hash":"_add_to_assemblies","id":8}]},"537":{"id":537,"text":"This document will explain how a developer can add samples to the plugins in the source code so that they will end up in the samples project in the Hop client distribution assembly. The samples project in the Hop distribution is located in the config/projects/samples folder. Its parent is the default project. This means that it’s not needed to add any metadata objects (like run configurations) to the samples projects that are already present in the default project. If a plugin places a samples/ folder under the src/main/ folder its content will be picked up and copied over the samples project folder. The content will end up exactly in the same folder structure. A few examples: Source Target plugins/transforms/addsequence/src/main/samples/transforms/add-sequence-add-a-unique-id.hpl config/projects/samples/transforms/add-sequence-add-a-unique-id.hpl plugins/engines/beam/src/main/samples/metadata/pipeline-run-configuration/Direct.json config/projects/samples/metadata/pipeline-run-configuration/Direct.json As you can see it’s easy to add extra metadata simply by putting it in the metadata/ folder under your samples/ folder in the plugin. The same goes for test data datasets and so on. If you have metadata objects, sample input files data sets or files that you might want to make available for all plugins, please add them to the following place in the source code: assemblies/static/src/main/resources/config/projects/samples When naming samples and folders please stick to the following basic rules: The filenames start with the name of the transform, action or plugin All lowercase No spaces in the filename or underscores: use dashes (-) Put plugins in the right folders: transform samples to in transforms/, action samples go in actions/ and so on. Keep things clean. If you need to add input files for your sample put them in a files/ sub-folder like transforms/files Please use our best practices guide to create the examples.

You need to include the Apache repository in your pom.xml. Apache https://repository.apache.org/snapshots/ Apache Repository true false To speed up searching for plugin annotations Apache Hop uses a Java Annotations Index: Jandex. Unless you have such an index in your plugin JAR file Hop will not pick it up. To add the index you simply need to add the plugin to your maven pom.xml: ... 3.1.6 ... ... ... io.smallrye jandex-maven-plugin ${jandex.version} ... io.smallrye jandex-maven-plugin make-index jandex For more information about Jandex, please see: https://github.com/wildfly/jandex-maven-plugin/ After the build and the Java annotations index was made you should see a file called META-INF/jandex.idx in your plugin JAR file. All interface classes have changed from Interface to I. For example: RowMetaInterface → IRowMeta Transformations are now called Pipelines. This means that the corresponding classes have changed. For example: - TransMeta is now called PipelineMeta - Trans is now called Pipeline Steps are now called Transforms. For example: StepMeta is now called TransformMeta StepMetaInterface is now called ITransformMeta BaseStep is now called BaseTransform StepDataInterface is now called ITransformData …​and so on === Transform Generics ITransform no longer expects you to pass ITransformMeta and ITransformData classes in the following methods: processRow() init() dispose() stopRunning() This greatly simplifies the code. Your need to let Hop know what the relationship is between your implementation of ITransform, ITransformMeta, ITransformData, for example: public class Sample extends BaseTransform implements ITransform { ... } The same is true for your implementation of ITransformMeta: public class SampleMeta extends BaseTransformMeta implements ITransformMeta { ... } Any references to Repository, including parameters and the saveRep() and loadRep() methods in Transforms and Actions can be safely removed VariableSpace was renamed to IVariables The API has also been cleaned up and simplified. For example, environmentSubstitute() is now called resolve() Please note that metadata objects (TransMeta, JobMeta, DatabaseMeta, …​) no longer implement VariableSpace (or IVariables). Only runtime objects like Pipeline, Workflow, ITransform and so on have a state in Hop. If you’re porting classes implementing an Extension Point plugin by implementing ExtensionPointInterface please note that you’ll receive an extra parameter which is IVariables. It aims to contain the variables of the parent object in the XP context. Obviously the interface name changed to IExtensionPoint. You can also use generics to specify the expected class of the receiving subject. These objects are no longer stored in a Pipeline or a Workflow, they are now fully shared objects so any references of those in the interface methods of Transforms and Actions can be safely removed: List databases List slaveServers The MetaStore code is unfortunately LGPL licensed and for that reason removed from the project. It was replaced by the general IHopMetadataProvider instead of the IMetaStore references. At any given time you can ask the current IHopMetadataProvider to give you a serializer for a metadata class. This IHopMetadataSerializer can then be used to CRUD objects as well as list and so on. For more information on how to implement Hop Metadata plugins, see: Metadata Plugins. MetaStore elements can now be managed in a standard way. In your transform dialogs you can use the widget: MetaSelectionLine This will take care of adding label, tooltip, combo box and a few buttons to manage the metastore elements.","title":"Porting Kettle Plugins","component":"dev-manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"porting-kettle-plugins","url":"/dev-manual/latest/porting-kettle-plugins.html","titles":[{"text":"Change maven dependencies","hash":"_change_maven_dependencies","id":1},{"text":"Jandex","hash":"_jandex","id":2},{"text":"API changes","hash":"_api_changes","id":3},{"text":"Interface naming","hash":"_interface_naming","id":4},{"text":"Transformations","hash":"_transformations","id":5},{"text":"Steps","hash":"_steps","id":6},{"text":"Repository","hash":"_repository","id":7},{"text":"VariableSpace","hash":"_variablespace","id":8},{"text":"Extension point plugins","hash":"_extension_point_plugins","id":9},{"text":"Slave Servers and Database Connections","hash":"_slave_servers_and_database_connections","id":10},{"text":"MetaStore → HopMetadata","hash":"_metastore_hopmetadata","id":11}]},"539":{"id":539,"text":"Thank you for wanting to help out with the development of Apache Hop. We really value your help. We assume you’re going to be using the IntelliJ IDEA integrated development environment. If you visit the Apache Hop code on github you’ll notice a Fork icon on the top right of the page: Use this button to create a copy of the complete Hop codebase. You can then work on this fork in all safety. We call this new fork \"origin\" and the master copy of the Hop codebase \"upstream\" from your point of view. Now that you have your own fork it’s time to clone it onto your work computer. We’re going to assume you set up github security with proper keys and so on. To get the URL of your fork you can use the copy button on this GitHub page: You can now run a command like this: git clone git@github.com:YourAccount/hop.git Once it’s done you’ll have a new hop folder containing the project. In IDEA you can use menu : File / New / Project from existing sources…​ This will ask you to navigate to our new hop folder. Then you need to choose to import the project from external model \"Maven\": Alternatively, you can develop remotely with IDEA and gitpod.io. You’ll need JetBrains Gateway with the Gitpod plugin as explained here. Gitpod will open your project in a web-based VS Code by default. After you change your proferences to IntelliJ, your browser will launch the remote development environment. Once you’ve started a gitpod workspace for your Apache Hop fork, all build operations etc work just like they would in your local development environment. The Hop gitpod configuration comes with a desktop that can be used to run Hop Gui and test your work. Your desktop can be accessed by prefixing your workspace’s url with 6080, e.g. https://6080-your-gitpod-url.gitpod.io. The default permissions in the Github-Githop integration are quite restrictive. You’ll need to allow yourself to write to your (public) repository before you will be able to push your changes. To build your fork you can use Maven. Run the following command to build Hop and run all unit tests: mvn clean install Please make sure all the files you added or changed have the proper license header. You can run the following command to verify this: mvn apache-rat:check IMPORTANT: At the very least make sure to run the above 2 commands before generating a pull request against the \"upstream\" Hop source code. Tip : to run Maven quicker in parallel and by skipping the unit tests you can use the following command: mvn -T4 -DskipTests=true clean install Replace 4 by the number of threads you can spend on your computer. Beyond following the obvious best practices of coding Java it’s important to note that we are using a code formatter called google-java-format To install it in IntelliJ IDEA: Go to File → Settings → Plugins. Activate the Marketplace tab. Search for the plugin google-java-format by Google. Install it. Restart IntelliJ IDEA. All code which gets accepted into Hop is re-formatted with google-java-format via the pull request validation system. Please consider setting up an APL copyright header. In Idea this is done like this: File / Settings…​ / Editor - Copyright Create a new copyright profile called \"APL\" with the following content: Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more contributor license agreements.

It will automatically insert the license header in your .hpl and .hwf files. After a successful build, the Hop UI can be started. $ cd assemblies/client/target $ unzip hop-client-*.zip $ cd hop On Windows, run hop-gui.bat, on Mac and Linux, run hop-gui.sh To debug the Hop GUI or a long running pipeline or workflow you can change the launch scripts and uncomment the line with the 5005 port in it: # optional line for attaching a debugger # HOP_OPTIONS=\"${HOP_OPTIONS} -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005\" To debug the Hop GUI you should run hop-gui.bat DEBUG passing DEBUG as parameter On IntelliJ you can now start a remote debugging session using the menu: Run — Attach to process…​ You can now set breakpoints in your code and see what’s going on. Updating your fork can be done simply by committing locally and then pushing those changes to \"origin\". Make sure to always reference a #12345 GitHub issue! For example: git commit -m \"#12345 : My work description\" . After a while it’s likely your \"origin\" fork will be lagging behind with the main \"upstream\" Hop codebase. You can develop against the main branch of the codebase or you can create different branches for the features you’re building or the GitHub issue you’re fixing. In the commands below we assume you want to update your main branch. If this is not the case, replace main with the branch you’re interested in and later want to generate a pull request for. To update it you can add \"upstream\" to your local configuration: git remote add upstream git@github.com:apache/hop.git Then you can fetch all the changes from \"upstream\": git fetch upstream main We now want to catch up by pulling all the changes from \"upstream\" and by doing a rebase at the same time. git pull --rebase upstream main Now of-course we want to update our \"origin\" fork as well: git push --force-with-lease origin main Changes to the Hop codebase are done through Pull Requests. They’ll be built, compiled, tested and reviewed. On the github page of your \"origin\" fork you’ll now see something like the following: You can now choose to create the Pull Request using the shown button. If all goes well you should see something like the following: After you hit the green \"Create pull request\" button you will be presented with the opportunity to describe the changes. Make sure to reference the right GitHub Issue and leave useful tips for the reviewers of the changes. Again: as mentioned above please make sure your project builds and all tests succeed. Once you created the pull request we will run all sorts of tests and this will take some time. You can check the pull request to see how it’s doing: If the pull request doesn’t build you can look at the details and fix it easily by simply pushing another commit to your \"origin\" fork. It will be automatically added to the pull request and it will re-run the build and tests. If you want to review someone else’s pull request you can check out a pull request in a different branch. Before you do this, commit or stash all the changes you’re making yourself in the branch you’re currently using. Then fetch the pull request changes themselves, with 1234 being the pull request number and pr1234 the name of the new branch you want to create locally: git fetch upstream pull/1234/head:pr1234 Now we can check out this branch: git checkout pr1234 You now have the state of the source code in the pull request and you can build and test the project.","title":"Setting up your development environment","component":"dev-manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"setup-dev-environment","url":"/dev-manual/latest/setup-dev-environment.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Fork Apache Hop!","hash":"_fork_apache_hop","id":2},{"text":"Clone it","hash":"_clone_it","id":3},{"text":"Import the project","hash":"_import_the_project","id":4},{"text":"Building the project","hash":"_building_the_project","id":5},{"text":"Code formatting","hash":"_code_formatting","id":6},{"text":"Copyright","hash":"_copyright","id":7},{"text":"Run Apache Hop","hash":"_run_apache_hop","id":8},{"text":"Debugging on linux","hash":"_debugging_on_linux","id":9},{"text":"Debugging on Windows","hash":"_debugging_on_windows","id":10},{"text":"Attach debug process on IntelliJ","hash":"_attach_debug_process_on_intellij","id":11},{"text":"Committing work","hash":"_committing_work","id":12},{"text":"Updating your fork","hash":"_updating_your_fork","id":13},{"text":"Generating a pull request","hash":"_generating_a_pull_request","id":14},{"text":"Evaluating a pull request","hash":"_evaluating_a_pull_request","id":15}]},"540":{"id":540,"text":"This guide is to help you set up and start development on a plugin that will not be included in the Hop repository.

To see which dependencies are allowed in an Apache project check following page. If your plugin consists of code and dependencies in category A it can safely be added to the Hop repository and community can help maintain the code.

Every user session is associated with a display. In RAP, Display#getDefault() will not create a new display when it’s called from non-UI thread - read Display#getDefault JavaDoc. When you execute a code in a background thread, RAP needs to know for which UI session (display) it belongs. That’s why you have to provide the correct UISession/display from outside. Display.getDefault() cannot be used in non-UI thread with RAP/RWT. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=569046 A menuitem with SWT.CASCADE without a submenu looks and behaves differently from SWT. SWT: The menuitem does not have a right arrow on the right hand of the menu text. The menuitem is clickable. RWT: The menuitem has a right arrow. The menuitem is NOT clickable. This method is not implemented in RAP/RWT. Hop Web now has 2 themes implemented: \"light\" and \"dark\". They are selected with the system environment variable HOP_WEB_THEME which you can pass to a docker container using --env HOP_WEB_THEME=dark. The default theme is light To change a theme you need to look in 2 different locations: The colors of the various widgets, windows, the icons used and so on are defined in css files: For the dark theme: rap/src/main/resources/org/apache/hop/ui/hopgui/dark-mode.css For the light theme: rap/src/main/resources/org/apache/hop/ui/hopgui/light-mode.css The Eclipse RAP theming reference is found here. When icons are moved, lassoed and so on we have a bit of JavaScript taking care of those operations. You can find the relevant files handling that over here: For the dark theme: rap/src/main/resources/org/apache/hop/ui/hopgui/canvas-dark.js For the light theme: rap/src/main/resources/org/apache/hop/ui/hopgui/canvas-light.js If you have built the project using mvn clean install you can build a local hop-web docker container to test with the following script: docker/create_hop_web_container.sh You can also do this incrementally for the following modules: core engine ui rap If you rebuild any of these modules after changes you can simply run docker/create_hop_web_container.sh and this script it will incorporate your changes in the container.

The singleton pattern is a design pattern where only one instance of a class is created. This pattern can be seen here and there in Spoon’s source code. An example is GUIResource, which mainly manages colors, fonts, and images. The following code snippet (excerpt of here) illustrates how it is ensured that GUIResource can only be instantiated once. The resources (colors, fonts, and images) are accessed through GUIResource.getInstance(). public class GUIResource { private static GUIResource guiResource; // Making the constructor private prevents instantiation from outside private GUIResource( Display display ) { ... } public static final GUIResource getInstance() { if ( guiResource != null ) { return guiResource; } guiResource = new GUIResource( PropsUI.getDisplay() ); return guiResource; } } Spoon is another example that takes the singleton pattern (not strictly as it can be instantiated more than once). If you look at the following code snippet (excerpt of here), you would notice that Display is a member field of Spoon. This means that Spoon can only manages a single instance of Display. The singleton pattern for Spoon class is nothing wrong for Spoon that servers only a single user, but makes troubles for webSpoon where Display is instantiated for each session. public class Spoon extends ApplicationWindow implements AddUndoPositionInterface, ..., PartitionSchemasProvider { private static Spoon staticSpoon; private Display display; public static Spoon getInstance() { return staticSpoon; } } Fortunately, RAP/RWT provides SingletonUtil as a remedy. Spoon.getInstance() in the following code will return an instance of Spoon that is unique to a session. As a result, each instance of Display can be referenced by their corresponding instance of Spoon. public class Spoon { private Display display; public static Spoon getInstance() { return SingletonUtil.getSessionInstance( Spoon.class ); } } The rule-of-thumb is that such a session-unique instance should accessed only by the corresponding session and not by any other. Let’s look at examples below how this rule can be violated. The code below violates the rule, but how? public class RepositoryOpenSaveDialog extends ThinDialog { private static final Image LOGO = GUIResource.getInstance().getImageLogoSmall(); } Let us assume that GUIResource has already been adapted to RAP/RWT and GUIResource.getInstance() returns a session-unique instance of GUIResource. An instance of Image returned by GUIResource.getInstance().getImageLogoSmall() also becomes session-unique. When RepositoryOpenSaveDialog is instantiated, say in session A, LOGO is instantiated and assigned with an instance of Image unique to session A. By the static modifier, LOGO keeps the reference to that particular instance ever after and returns that instance when accessed in any later sessions. Sharing session-unique instance of Image is not necessarily harmful especially when the image is inherently common to all sessions (e.g., the kettle small logo). However, issues like #92 happen when the session A gets terminated and the instance of Image is disposed, but accessed by another session. To resolve these issues, remove the static modifier as follows: public class RepositoryOpenSaveDialog extends ThinDialog { private final Image LOGO = GUIResource.getInstance().getImageLogoSmall(); } PDI plugins, even in webSpoon, have application scope instead of session scope and only one instance is instantiated for each one of these plugins (= effectively singleton). Let’s take a look at a modified snippet of HadoopClusterViewTreeExtension. public class HadoopClusterViewTreeExtension implements ExtensionPointInterface { private Spoon spoon = null; private Image hadoopClusterImage = null; public HadoopClusterViewTreeExtension() { spoon = Spoon.getInstance(); hadoopClusterImage = getHadoopClusterImage( spoon.getDisplay() ); } private void refreshNamedClusterSubtree( SelectionTreeExtension selectionTreeExtension ) { for ( NamedCluster namedCluster : namedClusters ) { createTreeItem( tiNcTitle, namedCluster.getName(), hadoopClusterImage ); } } } The constructor assigns a session-unique Spoon and (effectively) session-unique Image to its member fields. These member fields could be technically re-assigned but never in Spoon. In webSpoon, this code causes issues such as #23 and a non-reported issue resolved by adbb00a. To resolve the issues, stop caching session-unique instances in the member fields and retrieve them on-demand. The code below is the corrected one. public class HadoopClusterViewTreeExtension implements ExtensionPointInterface { // private Spoon spoon = null; // private Image hadoopClusterImage = null; public HadoopClusterViewTreeExtension() { // spoon = Spoon.getInstance(); // hadoopClusterImage = getHadoopClusterImage( spoon.getDisplay() ); } private void refreshNamedClusterSubtree( SelectionTreeExtension selectionTreeExtension ) { for ( NamedCluster namedCluster : namedClusters ) { createTreeItem( tiNcTitle, namedCluster.getName(), getHadoopClusterImage( Spoon.getInstance().getDisplay() ) ) ); } } } SWT can paint on any widgets or image, while RAP/RWT can only paint on Canvas widget. SWT supports the following codes: Image image = new Image( device, width, height ); GC gc = new GC( image ); gc.drawRectangle( 0, 0, 10, 20 ); but RWT does not. You can see an example of how this limitation has been overcame in pdi-dataservice-server-plugin.","title":"Developer Antipatterns","component":"dev-manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"hopweb-antipatterns","url":"/dev-manual/latest/hopweb/hopweb-antipatterns.html","titles":[{"text":"Avoid sharing session-unique instances among sessions","hash":"_avoid_sharing_session_unique_instances_among_sessions","id":1},{"text":"Example: use of the static modifier for session-unique instances","hash":"_example_use_of_the_static_modifier_for_session_unique_instances","id":2},{"text":"Example: caching session-unique instances in plugins","hash":"_example_caching_session_unique_instances_in_plugins","id":3},{"text":"Avoid use of unimplemented SWT APIs","hash":"_avoid_use_of_unimplemented_swt_apis","id":4},{"text":"Example: drawing on an Image","hash":"_example_drawing_on_an_image","id":5}]},"549":{"id":549,"text":"Hop Web is available as a basic Docker container image from Docker Hub. Check the user manual for Hop Web for more information. Follow the steps in this guid to learn how you can build your own Hop Web installation or docker image. Hop Web is built with Eclipse RAP, and translates the default Hop Gui desktop application into a web version. It is functional, but there are limitations. Feel free to contribute if you’d like to improve Hop Web. Hop currently doesn’t offer any standalone Hop Web builds. Running your own Hop Web environment is straightforward but requires you to build Hop. Follow the development environment setup guide to get the Hop source code and build Hop. The steps to set up the default Docker image are included in a helper script docker/create_hop_web_container.sh in the Hop code base. This should get you started to make modifications or create your own version entirely. Additional info in Building the Hop Web Docker container We’ll use Apache Tomcat in this example. If you use another application server, the process should be similar. Hop 2.x is built with Java 17, so you’ll need to download the latest Tomcat 9. Copy or extract the following files from your Hop build, where $CATALINA_HOME is your Tomcat installation folder. #unzip files for docker image unzip assemblies/web/target/hop.war -d $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/hop/ unzip assemblies/plugins/dist/target/hop-assemblies-*.zip -d $CATALINA_HOME/ Configure Tomcat to run Hop by adding the information below to $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh, anywhere before the last line (exec \"$PRGDIR\"/\"$EXECUTABLE\" start \"$@\") export HOP_AES_ENCODER_KEY= # specify where Hop should store audit information export HOP_AUDIT_FOLDER=\"${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/hop/audit\" # specify where Hop should manage configuration metadata (e.g. projects and environments information). export HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER=\"${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/hop/config\" # specify the hop log level export HOP_LOG_LEVEL=\"Basic\" # any additional JRE settings you want to pass on #export HOP_OPTIONS= # default Hop password encoder plugin export HOP_PASSWORD_ENCODER_PLUGIN=\"Hop\" # point Hop to the plugins folder export HOP_PLUGIN_BASE_FOLDERS=\"${CATALINA_HOME}/plugins\" # path to jdbc drivers export HOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDERS= # the theme to use (dark or light) export HOP_WEB_THEME=\"light\" # Set TOMCAT start variables export CATALINA_OPTS='${HOP_OPTIONS} -DHOP_AES_ENCODER_KEY=\"${HOP_AES_ENCODER_KEY}\" -DHOP_AUDIT_FOLDER=\"${HOP_AUDIT_FOLDER}\" -DHOP_CONFIG_FOLDER=\"${HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER}\" -DHOP_LOG_LEVEL=\"${HOP_LOG_LEVEL}\" -DHOP_PASSWORD_ENCODER_PLUGIN=\"${HOP_PASSWORD_ENCODER_PLUGIN}\" -DHOP_PLUGIN_BASE_FOLDERS=\"${HOP_PLUGIN_BASE_FOLDERS}\" -DHOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDERS=\"${HOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDERS}\" -DHOP_WEB_THEME=\"${HOP_WEB_THEME}\"' If you want to run Hop Web with the default and samples projects, make sure the project root path in hop-config.json is set to `${HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER}. On Linux or Mac, use the following sed command to fix this in one line: sed -i 's/config\\/projects/${HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER}\\/projects/g' webapps/hop/config/hop-config.json On Windows, modify hop-config.json to make sure projectsConf looks like the one below: \"projectsConfig\" : { \"enabled\" : true, \"projectMandatory\" : true, \"defaultProject\" : \"default\", \"standardParentProject\" : \"default\", \"projectConfigurations\" : [ { \"projectName\" : \"default\", \"projectHome\" : \"${HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER}/projects/default\", \"configFilename\" : \"project-config.json\" }, { \"projectName\" : \"samples\", \"projectHome\" : \"${HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER}/projects/samples\", \"configFilename\" : \"project-config.json\" } ] } To make sure all hop scripts are accessible and work correctly with Hop Web, update their classpaths: This can be done with a couple of sed commands on Mac and Linux: RUN sed -i 's&lib/core/*&../../lib/*:WEB-INF/lib/*:lib/core/*&g' ${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/ROOT/hop-run.sh RUN sed -i 's&lib/core/*&../../lib/*:WEB-INF/lib/*:lib/core/*&g' ${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/ROOT/hop-conf.sh RUN sed -i 's&lib/core/*&../../lib/*:WEB-INF/lib/*:lib/core/*&g' ${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/ROOT/hop-search.sh RUN sed -i 's&lib/core/*&../../lib/*:WEB-INF/lib/*:lib/core/*&g' ${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/ROOT/hop-encrypt.sh RUN sed -i 's&lib/core/*&../../lib/*:WEB-INF/lib/*:lib/core/*&g' ${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/ROOT/hop-import.sh RUN sed -i 's&lib/core/*&../../lib/*:WEB-INF/lib/*:lib/core/*&g' ${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/ROOT/hop-search.sh The CLASSPATH lines in the various scripts should look similar to the one below after editing: CLASSPATH=\"../../lib/:WEB-INF/lib/:lib/core/*:lib/beam/:lib/swt/osx/arm64/*\" Once the classpaths have been updated, make sure to make the scripts executable: chmod +x ${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/ROOT/*.sh Run bin/startup.sh (Linux/Mac) or bin/startup.bat (Windows). Hop Web should only take a couple of seconds to start. Access through http://localhost:8080/hop/ui to test.

This means we load configuration details, search for and load plugins and so on. You can do this with: HopEnvironment.init(); If you need to load plugins from different folders you can set system property HOP_PLUGIN_BASE_FOLDERS. The default value is plugins, the relative path to the installation folder plugins folder. You can add your own plugin folders with commas (,) separating the values. Shared metadata in Hop is handled by a HopMetadataProvider. When using the Hop GUI you store it in a project in the metadata/ folder. In that case you can point to such a folder with class JsonMetadataProvider. Note that you can serialize such a metadata collection into a single JSON string using SerializableMetadataProvider. This can be used to send metadata to remote servers and locations. When you have a provider you can ask it to give you a serializer with which you can add and retrieve all sorts of metadata objects. If you want to work with variables in your pipelines and workflows it makes sense to create a top level IVariables object. The easiest way to do this is with: IVariables variables = Variables.getADefaultVariableSpace(); This method also takes into account variables which are configured in hop-config.json (if that file can be found); You can get the pipeline metadata from a .hpl XML file using: PipelineMeta pipelineMeta = new PipelineMeta( \"path-to-your-filename.hpl\", // The filename metadataProvider, // See above true, // set internal variables variables // see above ); PipelineMeta pipelineMeta = new PipelineMeta( inputStream, // The stream to load from metadataProvider, // See above true, // set internal variables variables // see above ); Obviously you can start with an empty pipeline and add the transforms, hops you like: PipelineMeta pipelineMeta = new PipelineMeta(); // Generate 1M empty rows // RowGeneratorMeta rowGeneratorMeta = new RowGeneratorMeta(); rowGeneratorMeta.setRowLimit(\"1000000\"); TransformMeta rowGenerator = new TransformMeta(\"1M\", rowGeneratorMeta); rowGenerator.setLocation(50, 50); pipelineMeta.addTransform(rowGenerator); // Just a dummy placeholder for testing // DummyMeta dummyMeta = new DummyMeta(); TransformMeta dummy = new TransformMeta(\"Output\", dummyMeta); dummy.setLocation(250, 50); pipelineMeta.addTransform(dummy); // Add a hop between both // PipelineHopMeta generatorDummyHop = new PipelineHopMeta(rowGenerator, dummy); pipelineMeta.addPipelineHop(generatorDummyHop); The way a pipeline is executed depends on the run configuration you specify. To make it easy to get the engine we created a factory for you: IPipelineEngine pipelineEngine = PipelineEngineFactory.createPipelineEngine( variables, // see above \"local\", // The name of the run configuration defined in the metadata metadataProvider, // The metadata provider to resolve the run configuration details pipelineMeta // The pipeline metadata ); // We can now simply execute this engine... // pipelineEngine.execute(); // This execution runs in the background but we can wait for it to finish: // pipelineEngine.waitUnitlFinished(); // When it's done we can evalute the results: // Result result = pipelineEngine.getResult(); You can only inject data into a LocalPipelineEngine. Do so using the addRowProducer. Call this method after your run prepareExecution() so that the row producer can be attached to the correct transform copy. After starting the execution of the pipeline you can then use the RowProducer to put rows into the pipeline using putRow(). Make sure to call setFinished() when you’re done feeding rows into the pipeline. This again is only supported on the local pipeline engine LocalPipelineEngine. After prepareExecution() you can add row listeners to the various transforms: ITransform transform = localPipeline.getTransform(\"transform-name\", 0); transform.addRowListener(new RowAdapter() { void rowWrittenEvent( IRowMeta rowMeta, Object[] row ) throws HopTransformException { // A row was written during execution } }); You can get the workflow metadata from a .hwf XML file using: WorkflowMeta workflowMeta = new WorkflowMeta( variables, // see above \"path-to-your-filename.hwf\", // The filename metadataProvider // See above ); WorkflowMeta workflowMeta = new WorkflowMeta( inputStream, // the inputstream to read the metadata from metadataProvider, // See above variables // see above ); You typically start with an empty workflow and then add the actions and hops you want: WorkflowMeta workflowMeta = new WorkflowMeta(); // Add the Start action // ActionStart actionStart = new ActionStart(\"Start\"); ActionMeta startMeta = new ActionMeta(actionStart); startMeta.setLocation(50, 50); workflowMeta.addAction(startMeta); // Just a dummy placeholder for testing // ActionDummy actionDummy = new ActionDummy(\"Dummy\"); ActionMeta dummyMeta = new ActionMeta(dummyMeta); dummyMeta.setLocation(250, 50); workflowMeta.addAction(dummyMeta); // Add a hop between both // WorkflowHopMeta startDummyHop = new WorkflowHopMeta(startMeta, dummyMeta); workflowMeta.addWorkflowHop(generatorDummyHop); Workflow engines are also plugins. Which plugin is used to execute your workflow metadata is specified in a Workflow Run Configuration. To make it easy to get the engine we created a factory for you: IWorkflowEngine workflowEngine = WorkflowEngineFactory.createWorkflowEngine( variables, // see above \"local\", // The name of the run configuration defined in the metadata metadataProvider, // The metadata provider to resolve the run configuration details workflowMeta, // The workflow metadata parentLogging // The parent logging object ); // We can now execute this engine... // This execution does not run in the background. // When you get the result, the execution has completed. // Result result = workflowEngine.startExecution(); Everything that executes something worth our time is registering its own Log Channel in the hop LoggingRegistry. Every log channel gets its own unique ID with which we can see where a log line came from. You can access the Logging Registry using LoggingRegistry.getInstance(). It contains the execution hierarchy of Hop work. For example if you have the log channel ID of a parent you can see all its children with getLogChannelChildren() which will give you all the IDs of the child log channels. What we get is in effect the execution lineage. Whenever a log channel logs something using logBasic() or other logging variants, that text along with some basic information is kept in the Hop Log Store. You can get that one with HopLogStore.getInstance(). The logging lines are kept as logging events or class HopLoggingEvent in a logging buffer LoggingBuffer which you can access using HopLogStore.getInstance().getAppender(). If you want to grab the logging output of a pipeline, transform, workflow, action, …​ you need to start with the ID of the log channel associated with that runtime object. Usually you can do getLogChannel() and then get the ID or the shortcut: getLogChannelId(). If you want to get detailed information about every logging event you can ask for a list with: int lastNr = HopLogStore.getLastBufferLineNr(); List events = getLogBufferFromTo( logChannelId, false, 0, lastNr); The details allow you to see which line was an error, what the timestamp was, to which executable it belonged and so on. If you just want to see the flattened logging text you can ask the appender for the information: StringBuffer loggingText = HopLogStore.getAppender().getBuffer(logChannelId);","title":"The Hop SDK","component":"dev-manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"hop-sdk","url":"/dev-manual/latest/sdk/hop-sdk.html","titles":[{"text":"Initializing","hash":"_initializing","id":1},{"text":"Plugin folders","hash":"_plugin_folders","id":2},{"text":"Hop Metadata Providers","hash":"_hop_metadata_providers","id":3},{"text":"Variables","hash":"_variables","id":4},{"text":"Pipelines","hash":"_pipelines","id":5},{"text":"Loading pipeline metadata from a file","hash":"_loading_pipeline_metadata_from_a_file","id":6},{"text":"Loading pipeline metadata from an input stream","hash":"_loading_pipeline_metadata_from_an_input_stream","id":7},{"text":"Construct pipeline metadata with the Hop API","hash":"_construct_pipeline_metadata_with_the_hop_api","id":8},{"text":"Pipeline execution","hash":"_pipeline_execution","id":9},{"text":"Injecting data into a pipeline","hash":"_injecting_data_into_a_pipeline","id":10},{"text":"Retrieving rows from a pipeline","hash":"_retrieving_rows_from_a_pipeline","id":11},{"text":"Workflows","hash":"_workflows","id":12},{"text":"Loading workflow metadata from a file","hash":"_loading_workflow_metadata_from_a_file","id":13},{"text":"Loading workflow metadata from an input stream","hash":"_loading_workflow_metadata_from_an_input_stream","id":14},{"text":"Construct workflow metadata with the Hop API","hash":"_construct_workflow_metadata_with_the_hop_api","id":15},{"text":"Workflow execution","hash":"_workflow_execution","id":16},{"text":"Logging","hash":"_logging","id":17},{"text":"Logging Registry","hash":"_logging_registry","id":18},{"text":"Log lines","hash":"_log_lines","id":19}]},"551":{"id":551,"text":"The Hop SDK","title":"Index Page","component":"dev-manual","version":"2.10.0","name":"index","url":"/dev-manual/latest/sdk/index.html","titles":[]},"552":{"id":552,"text":"All files that are shipped with Apache software need to contain the Apache Software Foundation’s header.
