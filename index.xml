      <description>Apache Hop Graduates as a Top-Level Project DISCLAIMER: this is a reprint of the official Apache Software Foundation press release about Hop’s graduation.
   The Apache Software Foundation Announces Open Source data orchestration platform Apache® Hop™ as a Top-Level Project Wilmington, DE, Jan. 18, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today Apache® Hop™ as a Top-Level Project (TLP).</description>

      <description>The Hop architecture is very simple in essence: separate out any metadata from runtime code and tooling.
 Doing this, Hop aims to have a minimal installation footprint and wants to be stateless to facilitate execution on a variety of platforms like Spark and Flink, but also in a variety of scenarios like running in different life cycles such as development, test, acceptance, production, unit testing and continuous integration.
 The way these goals are achieved is by allowing orchestration workloads, defined in the broadest possible sense, to be defined as metadata.</description>

      <description>As always at the start of another new month, let’s have a look at what happened at Hop over the last month. Here’s the recap for January 2021!
   Apache Hop (Incubating) 0.60 Released Apache Hop (Incubating) 0.60 was released in late January.
 With 0.60 being the first Hop release as an Incubating ASF project, we focused on adopting the &amp;#34;Apache Way&amp;#34;, and made this a source code only release.</description>

      <description>Less than three months since Project Hop joined the ASF Incubator (late October 2020), we’re happy to announce Apache Hop 0.60, our first release as an incubating project at the Apache Software Foundation.
   Apache Hop (Incubating) 0.60 - Source only As stated earlier, one of the main goal of the incubator program is to give projects the time to adopt &amp;#34;The Apache Way&amp;#34;. As such, it took us a bit of time to get the entire process straightened out.</description>

      <description>We’ve had another couple of busy months at Apache Hop. A lot of these changes have been happening in the background, but are very exciting nevertheless. As we’re getting close to finalizing the background work, we’ll soon have more time to work on Hop platform features again.

      <description>Apache Hop - Incubation Proposal Accepted From the very start with Hop, we haven’t exactly been secretive about our intention to join the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and donate Project Hop to the ASF as Apache Hop.
 After almost a year of work on Project Hop, we’re very happy to announce we’ve reached a first milestone: the Apache Hop proposal was submitted to the incubator mailing list on September, 9th and has been accepted!</description>

      <description>We released 0.30 in late July, followed by a couple of weeks of slower progress because of summer holidays, but here we are with a roundup for July and August.
 After all the heavy lifting we did in the first half of the year, Project Hop now entered a feature-freeze phase. The focus now is on bug fixing, documentation and hardening the platform. Minor new features may continue to appear, just don’t expect any spectacular new functionality for now.</description>

 Example Priority 0 issues:
   the build is broken, halting all development
  the website is down
  a vulnerability requires a point release ASAP
    Priority 1: Critical This is considered a high priority. Most P1 bugs should block a release.</description>
