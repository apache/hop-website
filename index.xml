      <description>Hi Everyone,
 As discussed on the mailing lists recently, the Apache Hop community will move away from the Mattermost chat and switch to GitHub Discussions and the ASF Slack workspace for more informal community discussions.
 As discussed in the mailing list thread, there are a couple of reasons to do this:
   The current Mattermost chat isn’t hosted on an offical Apache Hop (sub)domain, which is something we can’t change.</description>

   The Apache Software Foundation Announces Open Source data orchestration platform Apache® Hop™ as a Top-Level Project Wilmington, DE, Jan. 18, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today Apache® Hop™ as a Top-Level Project (TLP).</description>

      <description>The Hop architecture is very simple in essence: separate out any metadata from runtime code and tooling.
 Doing this, Hop aims to have a minimal installation footprint and wants to be stateless to facilitate execution on a variety of platforms like Spark and Flink, but also in a variety of scenarios like running in different life cycles such as development, test, acceptance, production, unit testing and continuous integration.
 The way these goals are achieved is by allowing orchestration workloads, defined in the broadest possible sense, to be defined as metadata.</description>

      <description>As always at the start of another new month, let’s have a look at what happened at Hop over the last month. Here’s the recap for January 2021!
   Apache Hop (Incubating) 0.60 Released Apache Hop (Incubating) 0.60 was released in late January.
 With 0.60 being the first Hop release as an Incubating ASF project, we focused on adopting the &amp;#34;Apache Way&amp;#34;, and made this a source code only release.</description>

      <description>Less than three months since Project Hop joined the ASF Incubator (late October 2020), we’re happy to announce Apache Hop 0.60, our first release as an incubating project at the Apache Software Foundation.
   Apache Hop (Incubating) 0.60 - Source only As stated earlier, one of the main goal of the incubator program is to give projects the time to adopt &amp;#34;The Apache Way&amp;#34;. As such, it took us a bit of time to get the entire process straightened out.</description>

      <description>We’ve had another couple of busy months at Apache Hop. A lot of these changes have been happening in the background, but are very exciting nevertheless. As we’re getting close to finalizing the background work, we’ll soon have more time to work on Hop platform features again.
 Here’s what happened over the last two months.

      <description>Apache Hop - Incubation Proposal Accepted From the very start with Hop, we haven’t exactly been secretive about our intention to join the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and donate Project Hop to the ASF as Apache Hop.
 After almost a year of work on Project Hop, we’re very happy to announce we’ve reached a first milestone: the Apache Hop proposal was submitted to the incubator mailing list on September, 9th and has been accepted!</description>

      <description>We released 0.30 in late July, followed by a couple of weeks of slower progress because of summer holidays, but here we are with a roundup for July and August.
 After all the heavy lifting we did in the first half of the year, Project Hop now entered a feature-freeze phase. The focus now is on bug fixing, documentation and hardening the platform. Minor new features may continue to appear, just don’t expect any spectacular new functionality for now.</description>

      <description>Issue Priorities Priority 0: Outage This is reserved only for the most critical of bugs halting all development on the project.
 Example Priority 0 issues:
   the build is broken, halting all development
  the website is down
  a vulnerability requires a point release ASAP
    Priority 1: Critical This is considered a high priority. Most P1 bugs should block a release.</description>

      <description>Use Hop User List You should post and subscriber to the Hop User List for all your questions on using Hop, or how to do X with Hop etc. If in doubt use this list. The other list, Hop Developer List, is for the Hop team to discus development of the actual Hop project; do not use this list for question on using Hop. Again to re-iterate, use the Hop User List, for you Hop questions.</description>

      <description>The Apache Hop team aims to create a new release every 2 to 3 months.
 Here are a few directions that we want to explore for the future of our software:
   Authentication and authorization plugins for various security providers
  VFS:
  Integration with authentication for the VFS plugins, allow VFS configurations per project (instead of the current global Apache Hop configurations)
  S3 compatible object store support through updated AWS libs</description>
