      <description>Hi Everyone,
 As discussed on the mailing lists recently, the Apache Hop community will move away from the Mattermost chat and switch to GitHub Discussions and the ASF Slack workspace for more informal community discussions.
 As discussed in the mailing list thread, there are a couple of reasons to do this:
   The current Mattermost chat isn’t hosted on an offical Apache Hop (sub)domain, which is something we can’t change.</description>

      <description>As always at the start of another new month, let’s have a look at what happened at Hop over the last month. Here’s the recap for January 2021!
   Apache Hop (Incubating) 0.60 Released Apache Hop (Incubating) 0.60 was released in late January.
 With 0.60 being the first Hop release as an Incubating ASF project, we focused on adopting the &amp;#34;Apache Way&amp;#34;, and made this a source code only release.</description>

      <description>Less than three months since Project Hop joined the ASF Incubator (late October 2020), we’re happy to announce Apache Hop 0.60, our first release as an incubating project at the Apache Software Foundation.
   Apache Hop (Incubating) 0.60 - Source only As stated earlier, one of the main goal of the incubator program is to give projects the time to adopt &amp;#34;The Apache Way&amp;#34;. As such, it took us a bit of time to get the entire process straightened out.</description>

   Apache Hop Incubation - infrastructure Our migration to the Apache Software Foundation infrastructure is now done. All references to Project Hop have been changed to Apache Hop (Incubating).</description>

      <description>We’ve had another couple of busy months at Apache Hop. A lot of these changes have been happening in the background, but are very exciting nevertheless. As we’re getting close to finalizing the background work, we’ll soon have more time to work on Hop platform features again.
 Here’s what happened over the last two months.

      <description>Apache Hop - Incubation Proposal Accepted From the very start with Hop, we haven’t exactly been secretive about our intention to join the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and donate Project Hop to the ASF as Apache Hop.
 After almost a year of work on Project Hop, we’re very happy to announce we’ve reached a first milestone: the Apache Hop proposal was submitted to the incubator mailing list on September, 9th and has been accepted!</description>

      <description>We released 0.30 in late July, followed by a couple of weeks of slower progress because of summer holidays, but here we are with a roundup for July and August.
 After all the heavy lifting we did in the first half of the year, Project Hop now entered a feature-freeze phase. The focus now is on bug fixing, documentation and hardening the platform. Minor new features may continue to appear, just don’t expect any spectacular new functionality for now.</description>

The main focus of the preview version is UI changes.
 Following items contain the biggest changes but much more is happening.
