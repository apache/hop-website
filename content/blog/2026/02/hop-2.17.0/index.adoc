== UI Changes

The largest set of changes has happened around the UI and there have been some big changes, let's go over them.

=== Remove beta label from Portuguese (Brazil) language

We have reached around 70% translated, this brings Portuguese (Brazil) support on par with other official languages in the application.
I would like to thank everyone that has worked on these translations.

Current languages without Beta label:

* Chinese
* English
* French
* Italian
* Portuguese (Brazil) 

If you want to contribute to translations read our https://hop.apache.org/community/contribution-guides/translation-contribution-guide/[guide]


=== File explorer and Designer have been merged

You now have direct access to your project files while working on your pipelines. This way you no longer have to switch physical views to open project files.
We have also added a search function to quickly find files in a larger project.

=== New location and appearance for projects and environments

The project and environments buttons have been moved to the bottom toolbar and are using a new view to make it all a bit less cluttered.

=== New properties panel

The properties panel has had a major overhaul, all options have been: reviewed, renamed and tested.
We have added an overview that will show you all shortcuts that are available in the application.

=== Open HTML and PDF files inside the UI

You can now open PDF files directly inside the UI, when pressing the Help button the page will open inside a new tab inside the UI.

=== Error highlighting

When running a pipeline and encountering an error the logging lines related to that error will now be shown in red, this also applies to console output using our command line tools.

This feature does not work in Hop Web. +
When we write error lines to the console we detect if it is being printed or being used by an other command, if it is used by an other command we remove the control characters to set the colors. This can also be managed with the `HOP_CONSOLE_COLORS` environment variable.

Valid Values: +
true - Always use ANSI color codes in console output +
false - Never use color codes (disables coloring) +
auto - (Default) Auto-detect whether to use colors based on the output destination

=== Checkboxes with variables

You can use variables in a lot of locations inside Apache Hop, what wasn't that obvious is that we also have checkboxes that can be changed with a variable.
You can now clearly see which checkboxes have variable support and where to enter the variable.

=== A new look for the database lookup transform

The database lookup transform has received a new lay-out with tabs, making it less clunky.

=== Select values

The dropdowns in the Select values transform will now reflect the changes done in previous tabs.
It will only show fields that have been selected in the "Select & Alter" tab and use correct field names in the "Remove" and "Meta-Data" tab


=== Other UI fixes

* fixed some dialogs having inconsistent lay-out
* macOS fixes for background colors (still not perfect)
* avoid spamming "file reverted" when doing git revert on multiple files
* "Save As" will now use original filename by default
* inconsistencies in the save button enabling
* multiway join transform UI improvement


== Git improvements

=== git repository in parent directory

An option has been added to allow the git repository to be in a parent folder of the project you are working on. This can be enabled via settings -> git -> search parent folders for git repository.

=== Automatically stage files

When a file is already under version control and a change has been made to the file it will be automatically staged.

=== Git Info

The git information panel now has color highlighting for the git diff that is being shown.


== Filter rows

An issue was detected causing serious performance degradation when comparing to a static value in the filter rows transform

== MongoDB

We now have support for Atlas clusters and connections

== Hop Server

You can now start pipelines and workflows using a path, this endpoint requires an active project and will respect relative paths inside the project.
