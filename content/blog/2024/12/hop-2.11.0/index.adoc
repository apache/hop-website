Apache Hop 2.11.0 comes with a lot of bug fixes, code hardening and a couple of new features. 

== 4 NLP and LLM transforms 

https://github.com/ep9io[Tristan Everitt] made a major contribution to Apache Hop, with no less than new 4 transforms. Thanks a lot, Tristan! 

* **Language Model Chat**: lets your data interact with various LLM chat engines. 
* **Stanford Simple NLP**: parse and tokenize a text corpus for basic text analysis 
* **Detect Language**: detect the language of the content in a field
* **HTML to text**: convert HTML pages to plain text

== Git improvements 

After a first set of updates to the File Explorer perspective in Apache Hop 2.10, this new release adds improved git support to the perspective. 

Authentication and authorization have been improved, and additional branch operations (create, switch, delete, merge) have been added.

== Syntax highlighting 

Syntax highlighting for SQL and scripts was removed in the very early Apache Hop days. 

A new and improved version of this syntax highlighting is now reintroduced in Apache Hop 2.11.0.

== UI improvements 

* Some fixes in data grids when adding/removing lines using the toolbar
* Zoom in/out buttons in the main toolbar have been switched to more logical position
* Moving transforms/actions to the left boundary will no longer collapse them
* You can no longer move outside of the editable window
* Viewport takes up less space on large workflows and pipelines

== Various changes 

* a new REST connection metadata type
* a new MemSQL database type
* lots of XML Cleanup. Over 70% of all actions and transforms have been cleaned up and no longer use the old hard-coded XML serialization and deserialization. 

== Community

Without community interaction and contribution, Hop is just a coding club! Please feel free to join, participate in the discussion, test, file bug tickets on the software or documentation, ... Contributing is a lot more than writing code.
