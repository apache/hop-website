After a number of mostly bug fixing releases, Apache Hop 2.7.0 comes with a couple of new features.

== Redshift Bulk loader

The Redshift bulk loader transform allows you to use the COPY command to load data to Redshift. It is the most performant way to load large volumes of data to Redshift.
It can copy data to S3 and then load it in Redshift or use existing S3 files that have to be loaded.

== JDBC Driver refactoring

Depending on how you are deploying Hop this could be a **breaking change**.

We have restructured the way Hop handles JDBC drivers. Previously JDBC drivers were stored with the Database plugins they have been moved to a central location (`lib/jdbc`).
This allows multiple plugins to leverage the same JDBC driver and avoids conflicts.

If you were using the `HOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDER` variable you will need to update you configuration. The variable has been renamed to `HOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDER**S**` and accepts a list of folders by default it will point to `lib/jdbc`. More information can be found in the link:https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/database/databases.html[documentation^]

== Improvements

=== Enhanced JSON Ouput

Improvements have been made to the Enhanced JSON Output, a new feature has been added to simplify the creation of arrays.

=== Formula Transform

The formula transform can now use fields created in an earlier formula line. This allows you to make sub-calculations or use the result of a formula to feed into a new formula field.

=== Underline transform names

A feature that is sometimes missed by our users is that you can open the edit dialog of a transform or action by clicking on the name.
To highlight this feature the transform and action names will now act like a hyperlink. When hovering over a name it will be underlines to make it feel like a hyperlink.

=== Improved Brazilian

Since previous release over 5000 additional strings have been translated to Brazilian Portuguese, this brings the translation coverage to almost 40%.

If you wish to help translate Hop to your local language visit our link:https://translate.project-hop.org/[translation website^]. If you would like to add support for an additional language create a ticket and we will set up the translation service.
