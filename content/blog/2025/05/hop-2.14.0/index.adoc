== Updated release cycle

As discussed on the https://lists.apache.org/thread/hwnoo1dl1r2vk039qocsn2nbly1gvrbx[development mailing list], the Apache Hop project is moving to a quarterly release cycle. 
This means that this release comes quite quickly after 2.13 and is therefore quite small. The next release will be 2.15, which is scheduled for August 2025.


== Mail server metadata type 

Apache Hop now supports a new metadata type for https://hop.apache.org//manual/next/metadata-types/mail-server.html[Mail Server]. This allows you to connect to a mail server and send emails from Apache Hop workflows and pipelines.

The actions and transforms that use this metadata type are:
* actions: 
** Mail
** Get Mails (POP3/IMAP)
* transforms:
** Email messages input
** Mail 

To support this new metadata type, the integration tests were updated and extended and now use https://james.apache.org[Apache James] as a mail server.
