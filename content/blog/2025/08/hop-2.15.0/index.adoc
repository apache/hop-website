[[google-sheets-output]]
== Google Sheets Output: Option to re-create sheets and proxy support

When exporting data to Google Sheets, you can now choose to re-create sheets as needed.

image::/img/Release-2.15/google-sheets-output-recreate-sheet.png[Google Sheets Output Re-create Sheet Option]

By default, the Google Sheets Output transform empties the sheet before writing (or appends if you enable the “Append” option).  
This new option goes further: it removes the sheet entirely and re-creates it. This can help avoid versioning issues that can arise when writing to the same sheet repeatedly over long periods, such as hourly updates running for months or years.

[[duckdb-upgrade]]
== DuckDB gets an upgrade

One of our favorite in-process analytics databases just leveled up from version **1.2.0** to **1.3.0.0**, meaning faster queries, better compatibility, and more features right out of the box.

[[databricks-dialect]]
== Databricks dialect support

Working in Databricks? Now Apache Hop speaks your language.  
The new Databricks database dialect provides connectivity and proper SQL generation for Databricks environments, with primary support for **Databricks Unity Catalog**.

[[sql-editor-highlighting]]
== SQL Editor gets syntax highlighting

The SQL Editor in Apache Hop now supports syntax highlighting, making it easier to read, write, and debug SQL queries directly within the Hop GUI.

[[workflow-status-remote]]
== Workflow execution status feedback for remote engines

When executing a workflow on a remote engine from the GUI, you now receive **real-time status updates**.  
This makes it easier to track progress, spot issues, and confirm that your pipeline or workflow is running as expected.

[[janino-upgrade]]
== Janino Expression Engine upgrade

The Janino library, used internally to evaluate expressions within scripting transforms like **JavaScript**, **User Defined Java Class**, and **User Defined Java Expression**, has been upgraded from version **3.1.11** to **3.1.12**.  
This upgrade brings enhanced performance and stability, so your transforms run faster and more reliably.

[[bug-fixes]]
== Bug fixes & quality-of-life improvements

Apache Hop 2.15 also focuses heavily on smoothing out rough edges. This release fixes numerous bugs reported by users and contributors alike, ensuring a more predictable and enjoyable experience.

=== Real-Time Pipeline Metrics & Logging Fixes
Fixed a critical bug that prevented pipeline metrics and logs from updating live during execution after the first run. Now you get continuous, accurate feedback on your pipeline’s progress and performance in real-time.

=== JSON Input Fixes
JSON Input transforms now handle keys with dots (`.`) properly during scanning, fixing issues with nested or complex JSON structures.

=== YAML Input Cloning
YAML Input transforms now correctly clone output rows to avoid data corruption or unexpected results when processing multiple outputs.

=== GUI Enhancements
* You can now use `CTRL+V` to paste in the Search perspective.
* Editing datasets no longer causes focus loss.
* The “OK” button in transform dialogs now reliably applies all changes.

=== Azure Storage Metadata Accuracy
Fixed incorrect last modified times reported by the Azure Storage plugin — essential for time-sensitive workflows.

=== File Metadata Transform Behavior
The File Metadata transform now only executes when it has input rows, preventing unnecessary runs.

=== NullPointerExceptions & Stability Fixes
Various NullPointerExceptions across transforms and actions have been addressed.

=== OracleBulkLoader Manual URL Fix
OracleBulkLoader now correctly supports manual connection URLs.

=== Concat Fields Enclosure Handling
The Concat Fields transform now respects field enclosures during concatenation.

=== Updated Documentation on Parallel Execution with JOIN Action
Documentation now includes clearer explanations, practical examples, and best practices for parallel workflows with the JOIN action.

…and many other minor fixes and improvements. See the https://github.com/apache/hop/milestone/16?closed=1[full changelog].
