Apache Hop 2.12.0 is mostly a bug fixing release, with a couple of new features. 


== Variable resolvers 

https://hop.apache.org//manual/latest/variables.html#_variable_resolvers[Variable resolvers] are a new concept in Apache Hop. They allow you to resolve variable values in a consistent way across all metadata objects.

Apache Hop includes three variable resolver types:

* Pipeline variable resolver
* Hashicorp Vault variable resolver
* Google Secret Manager variable resolver
