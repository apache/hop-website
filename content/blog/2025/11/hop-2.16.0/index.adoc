== Table Output Can Update Tables

The Table Output transform can now update existing tables.  
This improvement makes it easier to build and maintain staging areas and incremental data pipelines without separate update logic - a major step forward for data warehouse and ETL workflows.

[[salesforce-oauth]]
== OAuth Support for Salesforce Transforms

Salesforce transforms now support **OAuth authentication**.  
This update enhances security, simplifies configuration, and improves compatibility with enterprise Salesforce environments. Users no longer need to depend on basic username and password connections.

A new **Salesforce connection metadata type** has also been introduced, making it easier to manage and reuse Salesforce connection settings across projects.

In addition, the **Salesforce Input transform** can now use Salesforce *keys* instead of *labels*, providing greater flexibility and accuracy when working with Salesforce data structures.

[[merge-diff]]
== Merge Diff: See What Changed

The Merge Diff action now shows which fields have changed values between data sets.  
This improvement increases visibility for audit and comparison workflows, making it easier to identify changes and ensure data integrity.

[[uuid-support]]
== UUID Column Type Support

Apache Hop 2.16 introduces native **UUID column type** support for both PostgreSQL and MongoDB.  
This addition enables more consistent schema management and smoother integration between relational and document databases.

[[json-field]]
== Improved JSON Field Type Handling

JSON field type support has been improved across multiple transforms, resulting in:

* More consistent parsing and serialization  
* Better compatibility with nested structures  
* Fewer edge case issues  

These updates make working with JSON data in Hop more reliable and predictable, especially in pipelines that process complex or semi-structured data.

[[parquet-input]]
== Parquet Input Enhancements

Reading Parquet files is now faster and more reliable.  
The enhanced Parquet Input transform improves schema inference, supports more data types, and provides smoother interoperability with data lake and Spark environments.

[[azure-key-vault]]
== Azure Key Vault Variable Resolver

Hop now includes an **Azure Key Vault variable resolver**, allowing you to reference secrets and credentials directly from Azure Key Vault.  
This feature helps organizations manage credentials securely and eliminate hardcoded secrets in workflows.
