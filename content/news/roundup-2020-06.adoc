# Roundup June 2020

Another month has passed, so here we are with a new roundup!

A lot of work has been done in the last couple of weeks. A huge thanks to https://twitter.com/mattcasters[Matt], who implemented most of the functionality that was added this month.

Here's what happened in June!

## Environments -> Projects, Environments and Purposes

The environments system, introduced earlier this year, was significantly extended.

* a **project** is a set of workflows and pipelines with their datasets, tests etc.
* **environments** contain configurations for the environments you want to run a project's workflows and pipelines. Each environment has a **purpose**: Development, Testing, Acceptance, Production, Continuous Integration or Common Build

Projects and environments inherit variables and configuration from higher levels, but can can also have their own.

All functionality to list, create, edit and delete projects, environments and their purpose is available in the `hop-config` command line tool as well.

## Apache VFS support

Hop now has support for Apache VFS, which provides a single API for accessing various different file systems.
As always, VFS support is implemented as plugins. The first plugins for AWS S3 and Google Drive are available, with support for Azure, Google Storage and HDFS on the way.

## New File Dialog

Hop now comes with a new file and folder dialog that does a lot more than just browsing for files and folders:

* project aware: the dialog 'knows' your project directory and navigates to that folder by default
* supports bookmarks for your favorite files and folders
* shows file details in the bottom section, greyed out for inaccessible files etc
* keeps full history of your activities

## Hop Git

Hop Gui now comes with git integrated.
Pull, commit, push, all without having to leave Hop Gui, and without interruption to the flow of your work.

This is a first but functional implementation, based on the SpoonGit plugin originally written by https://twitter.com/HiromuHota[Hiromu Hota]

## WebHop

WebHop is another area that has seen a lot of progress in the last month. The code was moved from https://twitter.com/HiromuHota[Hiromu]'s fork to a separate https://github.com/project-hop/hop/tree/web[web] branch in the Hop repository.

In earlier builds, workflows and pipelines couldn't be opened or saved in WebHop. That issue is now resolved with the new file dialog.

With the scaling and overall user interface improvements, Hop Web is taking shape to become a viable alternative to the default Hop Gui. Since both environments serve different purposed, we'll continue to work on both Hop Gui and WebHop.

## Search Perspective

From anywhere in Hop-Gui, hit CTRL-F. This universal shortcut opens the brand new Hop search perspective.

The 'Location' dropdown lets you search objects currently loaded in Hop Gui or in all of Project Hop. The search string (optionally) handles regular expressions and case sensitivity.

From the search results, double clicking an item directly opens the selected object.

As projects grow, search becomes a necessity instead of an option. As such, we're confident the Search perspective will become an indispensable tool in your day-to-day Hop work.

## Hop Preview

The last addition to Hop Gui in this list is a small (in size) but very useful new data preview feature.

The transforms now come with tiny icons at their bottom right corner. When clicked, the icons show a preview of the data at that transform's processing in the pipeline.

The preview (number of rows, none, first, last, random) can be configured in the local run configuration.

## Metastore -> Hop Metadata

While reviewing our licensing in preparation for the Apache incubation process, we found the Metastore to be LGPL-licensed.

This LGPL module created a licensing conflict (as is still the case in Kettle) with the rest of the (APL2.0 licensed) Hop code.

As we've gotten used to turn problems into opportunities, we decided to get rid of the Metastore entirely.

Exit Metastore, enter Hop Metadata, a much more lightweight and flexible serialization component for all Hop metadata objects. All Hop Metadata objects are now plugins, serialized in JSON.

## Plugins

The most important plugins have now been ported.

We'll continue existing Kettle steps to Hop and will start to include third party steps on a per-need basis.


## Documentation

Documentation writing has started, but is a tedious and time-consuming task, so bear with us.

Feel free to take a look at the documentation we currently have, and https://chat.project-hop.org/[reach out] if you'd like to contribute documentation.
We consider any error or incorrect information in the documentation to be a bug. Please create a https://jira.project-hop.org[ticket] if you run into an issue.

https://twitter.com/usbrandon[Brandon] contributed a first video on how to download, install and run Hop on Windows to our https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGlcYslwe03Y2zbZ1W6DAGA[YouTube channel]. Thanks a lot, Brandon!

## Future

While we're preparing for a 0.30 release, we'll continue our code cleanup, bug hunting and documentation efforts!
