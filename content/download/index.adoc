## Apache Hop

For each release you can find a download of the source code which can be used to build your own version.
We recommend using the pre-build binary release, this includes all dependencies required to run and use the software.

Apache Hop requires Java 17 to be installed on the system. Check [the docs] for more information about the supported JVMs. 

More information can be found in the readme files included in the download archives.
