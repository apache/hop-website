## Use Hop User List

You should post and subscriber to the Hop User List for all your questions on using Hop, or how to do X with Hop etc. If in doubt use this list.
The other list, Hop Developer List, is for the Hop team to discus development of the actual Hop project; do not use this list for question on using Hop.
Again to re-iterate, use the Hop User List, for you Hop questions. This is the correct mailing list, and have the most people there ready for helping you.

## Post plain text mails

When posting to the mailing lists, use plain text mails. Do not use HTML mails. HTML mails is more likely to be targeted as spam mails and will be rejected; as well it's not easily readable by others.
